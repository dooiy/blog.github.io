        <h1 id="The-question"><a href="#The-question" class="headerlink" title="The question"></a>The question</h1><p>The widespread use of the internet has given people access to information on a level never experienced before. How does this increase in the availability of information influence life in today’s world?”</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Everyone can dramatically easily surfing the Internet to get the information they want nowadays. In my opinion, this easy access to information has a deep influence in researching and entertainment.</p>
<p>To begin with, the availability of up-to-date professional information helps us to do research well. The information offered by some institute include some findings, professional survey, and achievements in particular field which gives us some background knowledge.  Without this information, we are likely to spend a lot of time on redundant work.<br><code>科研论文语聊积累</code><br>For example, when I was attempting to write an essay about a topic, I was easily get lost if I have little background knowledge. After getting information from the Internet, I can have a thorough understand of the topic. Additionally, a new</p>
<p>Secondly, we are able to listen to even all the music and watch large amount of movies through the Internet which means we can have recreation at home. In the past, there are only few films in the cinema. We need go out with our friends to watch a movie. These days, however, we can easily access to new films on the Internet at home. My own experience is a good example of this. When I want some music to relax, I just need to open the apple music APP, then plenty of music will play constantly. When I heard about a new movie, what I have to do is to sign in a movie website and enjoy it. I save a lot of time and money with the availability of the valuable information on the Internet.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways.  In my opinion, the most prominent effect of the Internet is that it has strengthened democracy.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, online investigative reporting plays a major role in exposing political corruption and keeping politicians honest.  In the past, there were only a limited number of news outlets and they often had deep connections to powerful politicians and were hesitant to criticize them. These days, however, there are many independent publications on the Internet that are willing to expose political misbehavior.  For example, an online magazine recently published a story revealing that the mayor of my hometown had taken bribes from a property developer.  The report was so detailed and well-researched that the mayor had no choice but to resign.  Although the evidence was not hard to locate, only this independent website was willing to write about it.  This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to strengthen democracy in the modern world.</p>
<p>Secondly, the free exchange of ideas found online motivates people to become politically active.  In countries all over the world, people use social networking sites to share their ideas and opinions.  While in the past people might have thought that they were alone in their beliefs, they can now realize that others share their ideas. My own experience demonstrates this concept.  When I was a university student, I learned that a municipal park near my residence was going to be demolished to make room for a parking lot.  This bothered me a lot because I enjoyed spending time in the park.  At first I thought that there was nothing that I, as an individual, could do to stop this from happening.  However, I later joined a Facebook group dedicated to opposing the plan.  When the members of the group learned how many people in the city loved the park we were happy to get together and enthusiastically protest in front of city hall until our voices were heard.  I think that finding each other on that Facebook group gave us the courage to actively protect our park.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has strengthened democracy in modern society.  This is because online investigative journalism plays a big part in keeping politicians honest, and because social networking sites encourage people to be politically active.</p>
<h1 id="revise"><a href="#revise" class="headerlink" title="revise"></a>revise</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways. In my opinion, the effect of the Internet is that it has changed the way we entertain and research.</p>
<p>To begin with, online movies plays a major role in recreation nowadays. In the past, there were  a limited films and they can only be accessed in a cinema. These days, however, majority of websites offers movies without charge. We are available to old and classic films which are hard to find in a cinema. For example， when I want to watch a classic movie named The Godfather, I have no choice but download from the Internet because it won’t played by a cinema. When I invite my friends to my house, we can watch as much movie as we want at home instead of going to a cinema. This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to change the way we enjoy movies.</p>
<p>Secondly, the internet is the major source for scholarly journals, current news and books which help us conduct research. Many reliable statistics, articles and other information can be found on government or educational websites, while in the past conducting research involved a trip to the library. My own experience demonstrates this concept. When I was a university freshmen, I was assigned to do a research related to an animal. At first, I went to the library and bookstores for valuable information. However, I later found that is time-consuming and I switch to get information from the Internet. A number of websites such as Goole and Yahoo offers information about any topic I desire. As a result, I accomplished the research quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has change our life dramatically in entertainment and research. This is because the Internet offers plenty of movies and because some educational websites contain a lot of useful information for research.</p>
