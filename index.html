        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</p>
<p>“Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children.”</p>
<p>Taken from volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. There is a lot of debate about whether life nowadays is easier and more comfortable than it was. In my opinion, life has never been as comfortable as it is right now. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, today people work fewer hours than they did when my grandparents were very young, which increases their leisure time and their overall happiness.<br>Today, almost all workers enjoy time off on the weekend. This gives them ample time to pursue their hobbies and explore what makes them happy. I feel that my own family’s history is a good example of this<br>Several years ago, when my grandparents began their careers, they worked six days a week.<br>In contrast, I work just five days a week.<br>As a result of my light workload, I have time for sorts of my hobbies, while my grandparents can only take up their interests after their retirement.<br>I truly believe that an excess of leisure time is the definition of living an “easy life.”</p>
<p>​Secondly, advanced kitchen appliances are ubiquitous these days, which make it easier for people to enjoy fulfilling and interesting lives.<br>when my grandparents were young, their typical kitchen was equipped with only a simple stove.<br>Today, it is easy to find a whole range of appliances such as microwaves, toaster ovens, mixers and so on.</p>
<p>I use them to quickly prepare my interesting new foods every night using recipes from all over the world.<br>While my grand parents ate good food, its preparation was often quite time-consuming and arduous.<br>and their meals were somewhat repetitive</p>
<p>文化设施。</p>
<p>City includes a vast number of academic and cultural facilities, which makes it easier for people to access.<br>When my grandparents were young, there was only one library which located far away from my grandparents’ home.<br>Today, a child who become interest in some of these facilities are able to go there everyday.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.<br>When I was young living in a city, my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend.<br>We attend book readings at local library, art openings at many of the galleries ,literary festivals during the summer.<br>As a result of attending these outings, I developed a very strong interest in artistic expression and decided to major in music at university.<br>without these ample facilities, I would never have made these decisions.</p>

        <p>#Question<br>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“People learn things better from those at their own level - such as fellow students or co-workers - than from those at a higher level, such as teachers or supervisors.”</p>
<p>To begin with, people above us with a lot of maturity and experience can teach us more than people at our level. Young people, who have little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, are able to weigh their options and consider all the factors, such as results and effects. Therefore, it is important for us to seek instructions from people at a higher level. My own experience demonstrates the importance of it. Several years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I have difficulties with my math assignments, I sought help from my classmates and they gave me various answers. Still I had doubts about these answers. In desperation, I consulted my professor. He had the experience and expertise to provide me a compelling solution. As a result, I developed a strong interest in this class. Without his help, I would never have figured out the solution of my assignments.</p>

        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“A person should never make an important decision alone.”</p>
<p>Taken from Volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>Everyone have to make various decisions in their lives. Some likes to make decisions by himself, while others prefer making decisions with their friends. In my opinion, making decisions with others is better than doing alone. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better decisions than youngsters. Young people, who have very little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, will consider all of the factors and carefully weigh their options. Therefore, it is important for us to seek advice from others so that we are well informed and have the benefit of their perspective and experience. My own experience demonstrates this concept. Four years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I had difficulties deciding which classes to take in university, I consulted my teacher and advisor. They had the knowledge and expertise to help me determine which classes were the best one to take for my own career. As a result of attending these class, I developed a strong interest in the class, and decided to major in music at university. Without their advice, I might have chosen unsuitable courses.</p>
<p>#Sample essay<br>​Some people prefer to make all of their important decisions without first consulting with others. I, on the other hand, feel that we should never make important decisions on our own. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, while we might think our lives are unique there is always someone close to us that has been faced with the same decision. By consulting with someone who has made a similar decision in the past, we can more carefully weigh our options. For example, when I graduated from high school five years ago I was forced to decide whether I should enroll in either a trade school or a university. I knew that a trade school would lead to more reliable employment in the future, but I also knew that a university would provide a more stimulating intellectual environment. I did not think that my old-fashioned and practical-minded parents would have struggled with such a dilemma in their youth, but when I talked it out with my father I found out that despite his tendencies towards conservatism and practical ways, as a young man he had given consideration to studying the liberal arts. As we talked about his motivations and some of the regrets associated with his decision I was able to more fully consider all of my own options.          ​</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that when we make decisions alone, we are more likely to make rash and impulsive moves. Talking about a problem with another person takes time, and thus our decision making process is slowed down. For example, when I decided to buy a new car last year I made purchase the very same day that the idea popped into my head. It seemed like a good idea at the time – gas prices were low and there was plenty of parking available on campus. However, when I told one of my classmates about my purchase she reminded me that gas prices always shoot up when we least expect them to, and that parking was easy only to find at that time because it was summer vacation and fewer students were on campus. Had I talked about these issues before buying the car I might have reconsidered whether or not it was a good idea.</p>
<p>​In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is never a good idea to make decisions without first talking to someone about them. This is because there is always someone in our life who has had to deal with a similar situation, and because talking about our decisions prevents us from acting impulsively.</p>

<p>#The Question</p>
<p>Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>These days, people have lots of dining options. It is now possible to eat food at a fine restaurant serving food from all around the world or use modern technology to prepare food in the comfort of our own homes. In my opinion, I prefer eat at home rather than eat out.</p>
<p>healthier<br>在家吃更健康。尽管餐厅好吃，但是油多盐多。长时间下去 过度消耗这些东西会导致隐形疾病。在家吃，我可以控制量，尽量避免他们。     虽然我的菜不好吃，但是这不能避免我喜欢。而不是仅仅喜欢事物，我的快乐来源于做食物，以及我的健康思想。</p>
<p>Having diner at home is healthier than at restaurant. Although the food prepared at restaurant tastes great, it includes a lot of oil, salt and sugar.<br>Home cooked meals are healthier than meals from restaurants and I strongly value my health. While meals prepared at restaurants are certainly delicious, they include a lot of oil, salt and sugar. Over consumption of these ingredients have a profound negative effect on our health and can lead to chronic illnesses.<br>For example, my uncle was a merchant who is so busy that he has no time to prepare his meals by himself and he was forced to eat at restaurants everyday. Over a long period of time, he got overweight. After that, his wife realized this problem and cook healthy food for him according to a suggestion from a doctor. As a result, he got better and pointed out that had he continued eating out, he will have had to suffer from a variety of illnesses.</p>

        <p>#The Question:</p>
<p>“Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.”</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>地球被伤害<br>环境污染     人类活动产生了很多污染，破坏了环境natural environment。 This is the result of    工厂生产industrial development，汽车行驶，都产生了有毒的气体。           尽管我们努力限制排放，但是还是不能inevitable避免伤害环境因为生产生活需要。           这些污染将对我们的身体有害，长久之后我们将遭受呼吸疾病，人类活动伤害了地球。    举个例子，过去 我家乡曾今是个美丽的农村 有很多树木与动物。 2而现在造了很多工厂和公路。工厂排放出黑色的烟雾，特别难闻。我几乎不能呼吸，只能迁到其他城市。if without that</p>
<p>human activity has caused most of the pollution that is damaging the natural environment. This is the result of industrialization. Although human are trying to limit <em>the volume of emissions</em> around the world, it will inevitably cause serious environmental problems. These problems not only affect nature but also have a terrible effect on human health and, over a long period of time, we will suffer from a variety of illnesses. My own experience is a good example of this. In the past, I lived in an area of China with beautiful countryside and clean air and rivers. But recently, many factories and roads have been constructed in my hometown. <em>Then</em> black <em>disgusting</em> smoke is emitted from these factories and I had difficulty breathing. Eventually, my family <em>was forced to</em> move to another city because we couldn’t endure the air pollution <em>any longer</em>. without these serious air problems, I would <em>never have had to</em> leave my hometown where I had lived for twenty years.</p>
<p>Many species are going extinct because their habitats are being occupied by humans. Without any place to live, animals have no where to immigrate. Moreover, human beings eat them as food and take their fur to make clothes. As a result, their population is declining in a quick pace and more and more creatures will only be seen in zoos and monuments when our children are born. For example, when I was a kid living in a rural area, there was a wide variety of animals in my hometown. I heard lots of birds singing on trees and saw plenty of fish swimming in rivers. These days, trees are cut and rivers disappear because of construction of factories and buildings. </p>
<p>物种灭绝     很多动物开始灭绝，随着人们的活动。      这是因为动物的栖息地正在被人类的扩张所占据。在这种情况下他们无处可去，数量越来越少。<br>Most of problems are controlled by ourselves, some of them have the hope to be resolved in years.   We are finding the balance between the development and the protection of our Earth.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. I am of the opinion that humanity has had a mostly negative effect on the planet.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, <em>industrial development</em> has caused <em>major air pollution,</em> which has a <em>terrible effect</em> on human health.  Every week I hear news reports about how horrible air quality is in major cities all over the world.  Additionally, we often hear that chronic lung diseases are on the rise and that there is connection between these two trends.  I am reminded of the years I spent living in Beijing, China.  After having spent most of my life living in the Canadian countryside where the air is mostly clean, I immediately noticed the smog and pollution of big city China.  Within months I was suffering from a variety of respiratory illnesses and had difficulty breathing.  I spent quite a few afternoons at a local hospital being treated for various throat and lung infections.  A majority of the population of the Earth now resides in cities, and they often suffer from the consequences of industrial development.</p>
<p>Secondly, human development has lead to a massive accumulation of trash, which <em>spoils the natural beauty</em> of the planet.  While in the past products were often made of <em>biodegradable materials</em> like paper and wood, today most <em>manufactured goods</em> are made of plastic that never <em>breaks down</em>.  Such materials sometimes find their way into permanent landfills, but often they just end up as litter.  When I traveled to the island of Borneo last summer I was impressed by the beauty of the place, but I also noticed that the natural environment was marred by an accumulation of plastic bags and water bottles that were strewn everywhere.  Had I visited the island a century ago I would not have found it tainted in such a way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that human activity has made the planet a less pleasant place to live.  This is because people are more likely to suffer from the effects of pollution than in the past, and because human waste has destroyed the natural beauty of our world.</p>

<p>These days, there is a lot of debate about where is a better place for children to grow up, a big city or a countryside. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. I am of the belief that life in urban areas is incomparably better for children than life in rural areas. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, young children who live in a big city are exposed to people from all walks of life which provides opportunities for networking. However, those kids growing in countrysides only communicate with few types of people. It is useful for youngsters to have friends from different walks of life because they will provide sudden opportunities to help young people find a satisfying job after their education. For example, My cousin grew in Beijing, which is the capital of China. He is willing to interact with people who speak a various languages and who have religious beliefs which are different from his own. Recently he found a business which provide him with a substantial income in the city he live. He co-found the business in a partnership with two friends he made in urban area. In contrast to my cousin’s success, children from small town have a limited set of contacts as their social circle expanded very little since their childhood.</p>
<p>Secondly, the two most important things in any child’s life are health and education. if children get sick in a rural area, there are no good hospitals to take them to. In contrast, kids growing in cities can easily access to advanced and careful treatment. Moreover, schools in the countryside are usually of low quality anyway, while children in large cities meet better teachers and receive high quality of education. For example, one of my friends grew in a urban city. The City include a vast number of academic and cultural facilities. His parents could easily take him to a cultural event almost every weekend. They attended book readings at local library, art openings at many galleries and literary festivals. As a result of attending these outings, he developed a strong interest in them. Now he enjoys a successful career as a artist. For this reason, I strongly believe that it is beneficial to grow in a city.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up in cities than in rural areas. This is because children from a big city have more opportunity to network, and because city can provide good health and education facilities..</p>

<p>There is no shortage of debate about whether it is better to raise children in a large city or in a small town. In my opinion, it is more advantageous to raise young people in an urban environment.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, cities include a vast number of academic and cultural facilities.  A child who visits such places on a regular basis will undoubtedly become very interested in some of them.  In addition, they will be able to make well-informed decisions about their future.  My own experience is a compelling example of this. When I was young I lived in a major urban area, so my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend.  We attended book readings at the local library, art openings at many of the galleries throughout the city, and literary festivals during the summer.  As a result of attending these outings I developed a strong interest in artistic expression, and decided to major in music at university.  Now I enjoy a successful career as a recording artist. For this reason, I strongly believe that it is beneficial to grow up in a large city.</p>
<p>Secondly, children who live in cities are exposed to people from many walks of life, while those in the countryside communicate with only one type of person.  Cities are usually magnets for new immigrants to my country, and are populated by individuals from many different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. It is useful for children to have friends who come from different walks of life.  For instance, my young cousin is growing up in New York, which is the largest city in my country.  She is still just a college student, but she is comfortable interacting with people who speak <em>a variety of languages</em>, and who have <em>religious beliefs</em> that are different from her own. Moreover, she recently mentioned that she was able to <em>find employment at a company looking for workers with an international perspective</em>.  Accordingly, I think that people who live in cities can enjoy a variety of beneficial interactions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up cities than in rural areas.  This is because cities are home to a variety of educational venues, and because they have very diverse and cosmopolitan populations.</p>

        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students’ sports activities as they give to their libraries. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>University libraries need more money to maintain their operation. These days there are plenty of employees who are sorting books and journals and are ready to provide assistance for students in the library. They need to be well paid. However, a sports team often only needs one coach for their training. In addition, masses of professional books which appear to cost a large amount of money are required to be purchased over short periods of time. For example, My university library is beautiful and offers many books for reference. When I forgot to return the book back to the shelf which I had just read, a worker would put it back on the shelf right away, which allow other students to find it easily. When I can’t find the book I want, I ask an employee for help and they are able to locate it for me. As a result, I had studied in the library efficiently with their help.</p>
<p>#Example Essay</p>
<p>Funding for athletic programs at colleges and universities is a very controversial issue these days.  Some people believe that universities should fund libraries and educational facilities rather than sports teams, while others feel that the opposite is true.  I am of the belief that universities should provide more funding for athletics.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>观点，these day摆事实。再换个说法说一遍观点    情况介绍，当他 他选择    这看起来很片面，但<br>To begin with, most universities <em>offer identical academic programs</em>, and are only able to <em>set themselves apart</em> from the crowd through the popularity of their sports teams.  These days there are hundreds of universities across the United States which are almost entirely interchangeable.  Only a <em>very select</em>  few Ivy League schools are known to be better than average.  It may seem somewhat arbitrary, but a sports team can help such middling schools <em>stand out from</em> the crowd and attract new students.  For example, my cousin is a very average student.  When he graduated from high school a few years ago, he chose to attend  California State College based solely on the fact that he loves basketball and that school is known for its on-court success.  This may seem superficial, but it mattered a lot to him, and according to recent surveys he is not the only student who chose to attend for this reason.  The college earned his loyalty as a result of <em>the care and attention it has paid to its athletic program.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, sports are very profitable and are a good source of revenue in today’s precarious economic times.  Schools across the nation are facing a funding crisis, but they still need to build facilities and dormitories for new students.  University sports are a huge business in America, and are even more popular than professional sports in a lot of areas.  These teams can generate money for their schools through corporate sponsorships, ticket sales, licensing and broadcast agreements.  These profits can then be used to pay for academic facilities, including libraries.  This type of operation does not always seem the most idealistic thing for a university to do, but it certainly is a pragmatic solution to some of the problems that schools face today.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that colleges should provide more funding to their sports teams than they do to their academic facilities.  This is because sports help universities stand out in a crowded market of schools, and because the profits they generate can be used to fund other programs.</p>

<p>#The Question:</p>
<p>Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of fellow students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer</p>
<p>#My Essay<br>独自学习还是与同学一起<br>独自学习好<br>理由一：安静不分心          独立学习给予了我们一个安静的环境，允许我们集中注意力。   与朋友一起学习，我们很难不讨论学习之外的东西（无意义的联系，make jokes）and as a result 我们分心了，效率也变低了。相反， 独自学习可以让我们集中注意力解决问题。这是因为我们可以想的更加全面。</p>
<p>理由二：独立解决问题，更能提升自己实力       独立学习可以帮助我们提高自己解决问题的能力。  很多同学在遇到困难的时候，很害怕而且很无助。这是因为他们经常从别人哪里获得帮助，从而丧失了自己思考的能力。 相反，在独自学习的时候，我们只能自己想办法解决难题，这强迫我们提高了自己的能力。在未来的职业生涯中，我们精通于处理问题，这让我们升职地很快。</p>
<p>everyone has their own prefered study methods, and all of them have their benefits. There is a constant debate about whether students should study on their own or study with their friends. In my opinion, Studying alone is better than studying in a group. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, studying alone provides us a quiet place, which allow us to concentrate on our assignments. This is because we are easily distract in group studying, regardless of whether we make firm plans. As a result, I heard about that many students studying in a group find out wasting time sitting together for their coming exams. On the other hand, when studying on their own, they focus on specific area of the subject that I am struggling with and thought carefully about it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, studying by ourselves can help us develop the ability to solve difficult problems on their own. Many youngsters become depression and helpless when confronting problems and this is because they are accustomed to ask for help from others. Studying alone force students to solve difficulties without other’s help and they can use this skill in their future careers.</p>
<p>#Sample Essay<br>Everyone has their own preferred study methods, and all of them have their benefits.  I am of the opinion that it is better to study alone than to study as part of a group.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, studying alone <em>allows me to focus on</em> specific areas of a subject <em>that I am struggling with</em>, rather than doing a broad overview of the class.  I always attend my classes and communicate <em>regularly</em> with my professors and teachers, <em>so</em> I am <em>constantly aware of</em> which topics I need to focus on when I study.  <em>When I study in a group,</em> everyone in the group has different needs, and the study session is required to touch on all of them.  As a freshman four years ago, I was not aware of this and <em>found myself</em> wasting my time studying in a group for an important European history exam.  I knew that I really needed to focus on religious history, <em>but sat uncomfortably through a group study session that</em> <strong>progressed through political, cultural, scientific, literary and artistic history</strong> before touching only briefly on the issue of religion.  As a result, I <strong>performed more poorly on the test</strong> than <strong>I would have if I had just studied alone</strong>.大一的时候，我不知道这个，然后发现我在浪费时间在团队准备历史考试。 我知道我应该集中于宗教历史，但是</p>
<p>Furthermore, I recognize that I am a very <em>social creature</em>, and this means that <em>when I study in a group</em> I am easily distracted.  I am not the only person who has this problem; many people will agree that they too desire to socialize rather than study when in a group of friends and classmates.  My example of studying for that European history class is a good example of this.  Not only did I <strong>suffer from the fact</strong> that the we only <strong>touched</strong> briefly on my problem area, but certain group members (including myself) were easily <strong>drawn off-topic</strong>.  We were quick to make jokes about the material <strong>being covered</strong>, or <strong>make tenuous and meaningless connections</strong> between those topics and our own lives.  Thankfully I have avoided this problem since then as I have decided to always study by myself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that studying alone is better than studying in a group.  This is because studying alone allows me to focus on the areas that I need to, and because it helps me to avoid  socializing when I should be studying.</p>

        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, increased knowledge). Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>人们为什么要参加大学<br>理由一：更好的找工作    学习专业技能     高新企业多    获得文凭   社会认可<br>people who have a university degree will be able to get jobs more easily than those don’t. Individuals in possession of only a high school diploma are employed solely in very low paying and low-skilled fields.Our society is developing in a increasingly quick pace and professional knowledge is required in more and more companies. Universities are the best place to achieve these professional skills.</p>
<p>理由二：获得更多的见识 认识更多的人 了解其他地区的文化 学习不同的语言 出国留学</p>
<p>#The Sample Essay</p>
<p>(the question used here came from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>There are a plethora of reasons why students choose to attend university in this day and age.  In my opinion, the single most important reason is to achieve financial security in the future. I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, a university degree is required in order to be hired at even the most basic jobs these days.  Individuals in possession of only a high school diploma are employed solely in very low paying and low-skilled fields.  This fact is evident to young people all over the world right now, and I believe it makes them feel quite a lot of urgency regarding their educational qualifications.  This is demonstrated by the fact that in the past, when people with just a high school education could get <em>satisfying jobs,</em> enrollment at universities was much lower than today.  Moreover, my friends and I have noticed that recently it has even become necessary to have a graduate degree in order to begin a career; no longer is it possible to achieve professional success with just an undergraduate degree.  It seems that this trend will not reverse any time soon, and thus students will continue to consider their financial future when making decisions about what to do when they finish their secondary education.</p>
<p>Moreover, universities provide wonderful opportunities for networking which help young people find <em>high-paying jobs</em> following their graduation.  The unemployment rate has been quite high for most of the past decade and it is very difficult for even well-educated people to find employment.  Many experts argue that the people we meet in university play a large role in our long-term professional success.  For example, my brother recently founded a successful online business which has <em>provided him with a substantial income</em>.  He co-founded the business in a partnership with two like-minded students whom he met in a freshman computer science class.  <em>My brother often points out that</em> the <em>partnership</em> which he formed with his students was even more valuable than the degree that he was awarded four years later.  <em>In contrast to my brother’s success,</em> many of my friends who chose not to attend university have <em>a limited set of contacts</em> as their social circles <em>have expanded very little</em> since childhood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that young people choose to <em>enroll in</em> post-secondary education mostly in order to secure their financial future.  This is because <em>a university degree</em> is a prerequisite for employment <em>in the modern era</em> and because universities provide students with valuable opportunities for <em>networking</em>.</p>
