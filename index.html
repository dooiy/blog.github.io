<h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h1><p>Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better financial</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.</p>
<p><code>When I was young, I spent a tremendous amount of money on video games and comic books.</code></p>
<p><code>When I **later** **enrolled in university**, I did not have much money left to pay for my tuition, and was forced to take out a significant number of student loans.</code></p>
<p>last year</p>
<p><code>my uncle suffered a major heart attack which required him to undergo very expensive bypass surgery.</code></p>
<p><strong>He avoided bankruptcy, <em>but</em> did have to ask his elderly parents for a loan to pay his bills.</strong></p>
<p><code>They, unlike him, resisted the urge to spend and saved money through their entire lives.</code></p>
<p><code>He felt extremely embarrassed about begging his parents for assistance, especially as he could have avoided the situation by emulating their frugal behavior.</code></p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost everyone enjoys buying what they want. Some like to spend money right after they earn it, while others prefer saving money for another time in the future. In my opinion, I think it is better to save money in the bank and plan for future. I feel this way <em>for</em> two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>people struggle to decide if they should spend money satisfying one&#39;s immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns</code></p>
<p>To begin with, having some money in the bank helps us deal with some of unplanned emergencies. As our lives are full with these emergencies, this money provide important assistance during the time. If we spend all the money we earned right away, we will suffer a lot. My cousin’s experience demonstrates that this is true. Five years ago, he had a job in a busy city. When getting his salary in the first week of each month, he would spend all of it on what he had planned. Unfortunately, his mother got a very serious illness<code>suffered a illness</code> two years ago, which needed a large amount of money in order to operate<code>undergo an expensive surgery</code> a surgery. <code>He did not have much money left to pay for the surgery, and had to take much time to borrow a lot from his friends due to his unwise financial plan.</code> Without prompt treatment, the illness of his mother got more serious. These days he is much more <em>conservative</em> in his spending, and <strong>carefully</strong> consider all of his <em>expenses</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large amount of money we saved for a long time helps us do expensive things such as traveling and studying abroad. As tourism is more popular than ever, the hotel owner has charged increasingly for accommodation. It is so expensive that we need to save money for a long time. For example, when my sister and I planned to study abroad in America, we were surprised by the cost we need. Both of us worked and saved money in order to afford the tuition fee and rent. If I spend money without limit, I would not make it and have the courage to go foreign country. This demonstrates some of the benefits of saving money.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is preferable to saving money for sometime in the future. This is because this money help us to deal with some unplanned emergencies and because we can afford some expensive plan with this money.</p>

        <p>##The Question</p>
<p>Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).</p>
<p>##Sample essay</p>
<p>Traveling is something I dreamed of since I was a child. When having a trip, people can have a friend with them or be alone. Both types have their own disadvantages and advantages. In my opinion, it is better to travel with a companion. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Tourism is more popular than ever and everyone has their own style of travel. Some people like to take trip alone, while others like to travel with a companion. Personally, I prefer travel with a partner. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone. As travel becomes more and more common, the hotel owner has charged increasingly high cost for accommodation. So sharing a room with our partner can cut accommodation cost in half. Not only that, people traveling with partners have better access to package deals on entrance fee, tours and other activities.<br>For example, last year, I have trip to Beijing with my best friend. Because a standard room in the hotel has two bed, we only need to order one for accommodation. On the way to the landscapes, we saved a lot since one car is enough for us to get there. As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plan and extend our trip for another week.    This example demonstrates the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking a trip with a partner has more fun than traveling alone. one person who traveling alone may feel boring while traveling in pair make any trip rewarding. When traveling to a new place with a partner, I can be able to communicate and share happiness with each other. However, if I travel alone, I may feel lonely in a totally strange and new place. My example can demonstrate that this is true. In my high school, I travel to Japan on my own. The trip is so long that I feel bored on the plane. I have no idea of how to communicate with local people which made me feel lonely during the trip. In contrast, when my girlfriend and I travel <strong>together</strong> through Japan <strong>last year</strong> again, I feel very happy and excited. As a result of that, I am relaxed and enjoyable. This example demonstrates the importance of a companion for creating fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in pair and this make any trip more rewarding. <code>A lone stranger can be seen as intimidating while a traveling couple is often considered more approachable. 使用while作对比</code> . For example， when my girlfriend and I take a trip to Japan,</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that traveling with a companion is preferable than traveling alone. This is because having a partner on a trip helps to save money and because our trip are more excited.</p>

Which country would you like to visit? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).</p>
<p>#Sample Essay</p>
<p>Traveling the world is something I have dreamed about doing ever since I was a small child.  If I was given the choice of visiting a country of my choosing, I would definitely go to Peru.  There are two main reasons why I feel this way, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, Peru is a land of varied landscapes and I believe that getting in touch with nature is the best way to enjoy a vacation.  Peru is unique in that it contains a tropical rainforest, some of the highest mountains in the world and even pristine beaches – all within close proximity to each other.  Few countries offer easier access to such a plethora of natural wonders.  One similar country is the United States; I remember that when I traveled across that country several years I was struck by how many different natural environments I was able to experience.  I felt that seeing such scenes helped me really get to know America.  I think that I could have a similar experience in Peru and because that country is much smaller I would have an easier and more affordable vacation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Peru is attractive because it has an extremely varied national cuisine.  I have heard that Peruvian food has been influenced by quite a few sources, including Spanish settlers, local indigenous groups and recent immigrants from the rest of the continent.  Not only that, but visitors to Peru can choose from several different dining venues, ranging from chic modern restaurants to charming street vendors.  I feel that eating the food of a place is another great way to really get to know a society.  I recall that when I visited Japan during my last summer vacation I felt at one with the Japanese people when I visited a local sushi restaurant.  I am certain that I would enjoy a similar feeling dining in Peru which would make a visit to that country very worthwhile.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if I could visit any country in the world, I would choose to travel to Peru.  I feel this way because of Peru’s amazing natural environment and its tantalizingly varied national cuisine.</p>

        <h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question:"></a>The Question:</h1><p>Neighbors are the people who live near us. In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good neighbor? Use specific details and examples in your answer.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Independent-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Independent-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Independent Essay"></a>Sample Independent Essay</h1><p>Neighbours play an important role in our lives, and almost everyone in the world has at least one neighbor.  For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor.  In my opinion, a good neighbor is both supportive and respectful.  I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full of unplanned emergencies.  Oftentimes the people live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong.  For example, my family experienced a major house fire several years ago.  It was a traumatic experience as it happened in the middle of the night and we lost most of our belongings.  Though none of us suffered any injuries, we did experience a lot of emotional trauma.  Our situation was aided, however, by a compassionate neighbor who immediately called the fire department upon noticing the fire and who also provided us with clean clothes, food and a place to stay for the night.  This example demonstrates how important it is to have kind and supportive neighbors when an emergency happens.</p>
<p>Moreover, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him.  People view their home as a sort of sanctuary from the stressful modern world and if their neighbors do not respect this belief they will suffer a lot.  My own experience demonstrates this reality.   Five years ago, I lived alone in an apartment in a busy city.  My job at that time was extremely stressful and also physically draining.  After a day at work I wanted nothing more than to go home and unwind. However, the person living in the apartment above me played loud music all night which made it almost impossible for me to relax.  He had no respect for those around him and thought only of himself.  In contrast, the person who lives above my family today does not do this and though I have the same job, I am better able to deal with its difficulties.  This illustrates the value of having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that good neighbors are both supportive and respectful.  This is because such people can help us handle life’s unexpected emergencies and allow us to feel comfortable in our own homes.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost Everyone in the world has at least a neighbor and neighbor plays an important role in our lives. For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor. In my opinion, a good neighbor <strong>is both</strong> supportive and respective. I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full with unplanned emergencies. If our neighbor do not support us in these situations, we will not make it easily. My own experience can demonstrate this. Five years ago, I live with my parents in a rural county. One day, I forgot my home key in the apartment and my parents need to work very late. It is so chill and rainy that I have no idea where to go. However, My situation was added by a compassionate neighbor who invite me to her apartment upon finding me sitting in front of the door and who also providing me with food and a place to stay. This example illustrates the value of having a neighbor who help us in these unplanned situations.</p>
<p>secondly, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him. People view their home as a sanctuary from a stressful modern world. For example, I live alone in an apartment in a big city. My job at that time was extremely stressful. After a day at work, I want nothing more than went home and relax. However, the person living above me played loud music all the night which made me almost impossible to sleep. He has no respect of those living around him and thought only of himself. In contrast, the person who lives above me today doesn’t do this. <strong>When he wants to organize a party, he will ask me whether it will disturb me. Because we respect each other, we can be harmonious.</strong> The example demonstrates how important it is to having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>

        <h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h1><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>When students <code>do research for their class assignments</code> they use both printed and online sources and both types have distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, I agree that <code>it is better to use</code> printed materials rather than Internet-based resources.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, printed materials such as books and articles are more reliable than online sources of information. <code>1.比较型</code> This is because websites can be edited by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they are <strong>qualified academics</strong>. <code>2.解释</code> As a result of this, articles in online encyclopedias often contain incorrect and <strong>biased information</strong>.  <code>3.结果</code>I have even heard that some people insert incorrect facts into online databases as a mischievous joke. <code>4.even 进一步解释</code> My own experience demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. <code>5.example</code> Two semesters ago, I was assigned a research paper in a freshman history class.  I cited data that I found on Wikipedia which turned out to be completely incorrect.  The information that I included in my essay was so hopelessly wrong that my professor spotted it immediately, causing me to fail the assignment and receive a fairly low grade in the class at the end of the semester.  If I had taken the time to compare what I had read online to a book or a scholarly article I would not have included it and not have received such a bad score in the class.</p>
<p>My own experience can demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. I was assigned with a research in a history class. I used the statistics on Wikipedia which turns out to be incorrect. As a result, I got an low grade and my teacher easily spot the mistakes I make. I think I would avoid that mistake by comparing the data from printed books with the internet.</p>
<p>In addition, books are superior to online articles because they provide a greater depth of information.  Books are much longer than online articles, which makes them useful to learners of all ages.  Students who use printed resources when doing research also benefit from the meticulously curated bibliographical information which they include.  I have personally experienced some of these benefits during my time as an undergraduate student.  For example, when I wrote a paper last semester in a history class, the very first book that I consulted contained a long description of the both the underlying causes and long-term effects of the historical event I was writing about.  In contrast, most of the online articles that I consulted contained little more than facts and dates.  As a result of basing my research on the book rather than the articles, I was able to write an insightful and nuanced essay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that print resources are more useful than online resources.  This is because printed sources of information are less likely to be biased or error-prone, and because books provide a superior level of detail on most topics.</p>
<h3 id="The-Question-1"><a href="#The-Question-1" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Doing research by referring to books or by searching the internet each has their own advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, using the internet to conducting the research is better than using printed resources. I feel this way in two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, the resources on the internet give students more up-to-date and more fresh information. Usually books in a library are renewed in a long time. They may not involve the recent accomplishment and survey which we need in our assignments. However, the websites of the government and some institute provide us accurate and new statistics. For example, I recently took a science class whose assignment is a research for the development of 3D printers which have a big evolution in last few years. There is few records in books when I search for the information in our library. But after I turn to the internet resources, I find a bunch of valuable information about how a 3D printer works and why it becomes popular nowadays. As a result, I finished the assignment well and get praise from my professor. I think I would not accomplished this by looking into printed materials in the library.</p>
<p>Secondly, when conducting research with our classmates, we can communicate and collaborate with each other though the internet. Doing researching in a group can accelerate the process effectively. However, it is inconvenient for group members to gather together to share the information they got in a room. With a lot of useful tools through the internet, we can communicate wherever and whenever we are. My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true. When he started university, he didn’t buy his own computer in his dorm. He needs to go to the meeting room with his classmates to communicate about their research everyday. After he has a laptop in the second semester, he can talk to his teammate through the internet just at his dorm.They can easily accomplish their assignments with the collaboration. He got a better grade and progressed a lot in the second semester. Without the efficient communication with his classmates through the internet, he would not succeed in this way by only using printed resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that using the internet are preferable to only using the printed resources. This is because the internet can provide more up-to-date and fresh information and because the efficient communication on computer through the internet saves a lot of time.</p>

        <h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h1><p>Some students prefer classes with open discussions between the professor and students and almost no lectures. Other students prefer classes with lectures and almost no discussions. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>Classes <strong>where students engage in discussion</strong> and classes where the professor does most of the talking<code>lecture-&gt;talking do talking</code> each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br><code>各有利弊</code>In my opinion, classes with a lot of discussion are better than those without<code>than those without</code>.I <strong>feel</strong> this way for two reasons, which I will <strong>explore</strong> in the following essay.<br><code>个人观点</code></p>
<p>To begin with, I <strong>feel</strong> that classes where <strong>I have the opportunity to speak</strong><code>转换</code> <em>help to</em> develop my intellectual abilities.</p>
<p>Classes where the teacher does all of the talking are very passive, in my opinion.<code>1.说反面</code>  They mostly just <strong>involve</strong> the memorization of facts and details which do not help students in the long run.<code>1.1为反面解释原因</code> </p>
<p>On the other hand, I find that classes which involve a lot of debate and interaction <strong>create</strong> very intelligent students.<code>2.说正面</code>  </p>
<p>For example, I <em>recently</em> took a <em>political science class</em> that changed <em>the way I think</em> about the world. <strong>The cut and thrust of debate in the class</strong> <em>made me consider</em> where my political beliefs came from and if they were actually correct.  I came out of the class as a more flexible person and more open to new ideas than ever before.  I believe that I would not have developed in such a way by just listening to lectures.  This example demonstrates how valuable discussion-based classes can be.</p>
<p>Secondly, classes that involve a lot of discussion can help students develop the skills necessary to work well in groups.  Many freshman students arrive at university very shy and unable to communicate well. Discussions in class teach students how to communicate effectively, and they can use this skill to excel in their future careers.  My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true.  When he started university he was a very introverted person and did not enjoy either communicating or working with others.  However, after four years of participating in debates, discussions and presentations in his classes he became a very confident communicator.  As a result, when he began his career after graduation, he excelled in group work and was seen by his co-workers and supervisors as a natural leader.  He was promoted quickly and advanced through the ranks of his company.  Without participating in discussions with his professors and classmates he would not have developed the skills necessary to succeed in this way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I feel strongly that classes which are centered on discussions between professors and students are preferable to those in which the professor does all of the talking.  This is because such classes help students develop academically and because they teach students the skills that they need to find success in the future.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Class have different organization forms according to the existence of discussions and lectures which has caused a disagreement on public. Although some argue that class with full lectures gives students more information, I am in favor of the view that discussions play an important role in class.</p>
<p>To begin with, discussions in class can motivate the class to become more active. If a class is full of lectures, the class is likely to be boring. So students tend to be distract from what the professor say. Also, with no discussion the professor can not know whether his students have understand his lecture. Conversely, if there are some discussions between the professor and students, the students would be enthusiastic to communicate with the professor. The lecture which the professor address can be adjusted properly according to the students’ feedback. For example, in my math class, my teacher Jason allowed us to discuss the difficult part of his lecture. When he know that we confront some complex concepts, he would give a specific explanation about them right away. Even if we have a little bit misunderstanding, he would correct it in class. So we are willing to interact with him. I progressed much more quickly with the important discussions in class.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the discussion students bring more possible insights and ideas related to the topic professor said which will in turn help students fully understand the main point.</p>

        <h1 id="The-question"><a href="#The-question" class="headerlink" title="The question"></a>The question</h1><p>The widespread use of the internet has given people access to information on a level never experienced before. How does this increase in the availability of information influence life in today’s world?”</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Everyone can dramatically easily surfing the Internet to get the information they want nowadays. In my opinion, this easy access to information has a deep influence in researching and entertainment.</p>
<p>To begin with, the availability of up-to-date professional information helps us to do research well. The information offered by some institute include some findings, professional survey, and achievements in particular field which gives us some background knowledge.  Without this information, we are likely to spend a lot of time on redundant work.<br><code>科研论文语聊积累</code><br>For example, when I was attempting to write an essay about a topic, I was easily get lost if I have little background knowledge. After getting information from the Internet, I can have a thorough understand of the topic. Additionally, a new</p>
<p>Secondly, we are able to listen to even all the music and watch large amount of movies through the Internet which means we can have recreation at home. In the past, there are only few films in the cinema. We need go out with our friends to watch a movie. These days, however, we can easily access to new films on the Internet at home. My own experience is a good example of this. When I want some music to relax, I just need to open the apple music APP, then plenty of music will play constantly. When I heard about a new movie, what I have to do is to sign in a movie website and enjoy it. I save a lot of time and money with the availability of the valuable information on the Internet.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways.  In my opinion, the most prominent effect of the Internet is that it has strengthened democracy.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, online investigative reporting plays a major role in exposing political corruption and keeping politicians honest.  In the past, there were only a limited number of news outlets and they often had deep connections to powerful politicians and were hesitant to criticize them. These days, however, there are many independent publications on the Internet that are willing to expose political misbehavior.  For example, an online magazine recently published a story revealing that the mayor of my hometown had taken bribes from a property developer.  The report was so detailed and well-researched that the mayor had no choice but to resign.  Although the evidence was not hard to locate, only this independent website was willing to write about it.  This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to strengthen democracy in the modern world.</p>
<p>Secondly, the free exchange of ideas found online motivates people to become politically active.  In countries all over the world, people use social networking sites to share their ideas and opinions.  While in the past people might have thought that they were alone in their beliefs, they can now realize that others share their ideas. My own experience demonstrates this concept.  When I was a university student, I learned that a municipal park near my residence was going to be demolished to make room for a parking lot.  This bothered me a lot because I enjoyed spending time in the park.  At first I thought that there was nothing that I, as an individual, could do to stop this from happening.  However, I later joined a Facebook group dedicated to opposing the plan.  When the members of the group learned how many people in the city loved the park we were happy to get together and enthusiastically protest in front of city hall until our voices were heard.  I think that finding each other on that Facebook group gave us the courage to actively protect our park.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has strengthened democracy in modern society.  This is because online investigative journalism plays a big part in keeping politicians honest, and because social networking sites encourage people to be politically active.</p>
<h1 id="revise"><a href="#revise" class="headerlink" title="revise"></a>revise</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways. In my opinion, the effect of the Internet is that it has changed the way we entertain and research.</p>
<p>To begin with, online movies plays a major role in recreation nowadays. In the past, there were  a limited films and they can only be accessed in a cinema. These days, however, majority of websites offers movies without charge. We are available to old and classic films which are hard to find in a cinema. For example， when I want to watch a classic movie named The Godfather, I have no choice but download from the Internet because it won’t played by a cinema. When I invite my friends to my house, we can watch as much movie as we want at home instead of going to a cinema. This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to change the way we enjoy movies.</p>
<p>Secondly, the internet is the major source for scholarly journals, current news and books which help us conduct research. Many reliable statistics, articles and other information can be found on government or educational websites, while in the past conducting research involved a trip to the library. My own experience demonstrates this concept. When I was a university freshmen, I was assigned to do a research related to an animal. At first, I went to the library and bookstores for valuable information. However, I later found that is time-consuming and I switch to get information from the Internet. A number of websites such as Goole and Yahoo offers information about any topic I desire. As a result, I accomplished the research quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has change our life dramatically in entertainment and research. This is because the Internet offers plenty of movies and because some educational websites contain a lot of useful information for research.</p>
