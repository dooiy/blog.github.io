        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>What are some important qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.</p>
<p>People today spend an enormous amount of time at their workplace, and how much they enjoy that time depends largely on the attitude and attributes of their supervisor.  I am of the opinion that there are two main characteristics of a good boss, which are his experience and his professionalism.  I will explore these two factors in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, the amount of experience that our boss has is very important, because we are more likely to learn from a supervisor who is very experienced in their field.  Young people who are just starting out in their careers absorb new information like sponges, but even older workers can learn from those who have been around for a long time.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  When I began teaching ten years ago, my supervisor, Simon, had been working in education for more than ten years.  I was just out of college and knew very little about creating effective lesson plans, engaging students or even how to complete my paperwork.  Simon took the time to show me what he had learned over previous decade, and therefore I was soon able to keep up with my officemates.  In contrast, when I moved to a new school earlier this year, my supervisor actually had less experience teaching than I did.  Moreover, when I struggled with certain aspects of my job, he had very little to suggest that I did not already know.  As a result, my professional development stagnated.</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that the professionalism  is important for a boss, as it is essential to the maintenance of a good office environment.  My sister once told me that her first job following her graduation was difficult because of how toxic the office was.  Workers were prone to gossiping, shirking their duties and arriving late each day.  This was seen as acceptable because most of the supervisors in the firm behaved in the exact same way.  My sister was miserable, though, because she prides herself on her diligence and her ability to complete her tasks with care and enthusiasm.  This situation is a stark contrast to my experience with Simon, who I mentioned above.  He arrived early to the office each day, and never engaged in idle gossip about his officemates.  The people he supervised tried to do the same things.</p>

        <p>#question<br>In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon. Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of reasons why human life spans are longer than ever before.  In my opinion, there are two main reasons why people are living longer, which are improvements in medical technology and  working conditions. In the following essay, I will explore these two reasons in detail.</p>
<p>First of all, medical technology has developed in amazing ways, and can both prevent and cure many different illnesses.  Hundreds of diseases that might have killed us in the past can now be treated in safe and non-invasive ways.  Not only that, but technology can be used to identify potential illnesses even before they occur.  For example, I was told that my great-grandfather died of a heart attack when he was just forty-five years old, despite appearing outwardly healthy to his family.  However, thanks to modern medicine, I now know that males in my family are genetically predisposed to heart disease.  Thanks to this information I know to be extra-careful about my diet and when I exert myself.  When I am older I will begin taking blood thinning medicine as a preventive measure.  My great-grandfather did not have access to the predictive power of modern medicine and was not able to protect himself like I do today.</p>
<p>Secondly, improved working conditions help us live longer, as humans today have safer and less strenuous jobs than people in the past.  My great-grandfather was not the only male in my family to die at a young age, as his brother passed away when he was in his fifties.  His brother did not die from heart disease, but died from lung disease brought on by many years of working in a dirty coal mine.  The physical toll of his work and the dusty air he breathed every day caused him to develop cancer, which eventually claimed his life.  He was not the only person in his society to be killed by his job, as it was common for men and women to work in dangerous resource extraction jobs, or to put in twelve hour days at terribly unsafe factories.  People back then had neither safe working conditions nor effective safety equipment.  Modern workplace safety rules and regulations, however, prevent the same tragedies from happening today.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that people are living longer today for two main reasons.  They are that doctors have access to a wide range of technology to both cure and prevent illnesses, and because our jobs are safer and less taxing than in the past.</p>

        <p>The Question</p>
<p>Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.</p>
<p>Attending class physically makes it more likely that a student will participate in conversation and debate, which develop the skills necessary to work well in groups.<br>Many students arrive at school, very shy and unable to communicate well.<br>Communication and discussion in class teach students how to communicate efficiently. They can use this skill to excel in their future career.<br>My cousin’s example can demonstrate the importance of attending class.<br>Few years ago, When he started university, he was uncomfortable either speaking in front of crowds or working with others.<br>After four years of attending class, he became proficient at communication.<br>As a result, as he began his career after graduation, he excelled in group work and was seen by his co-worker and supervisors as a natural leader. He promoted quickly in the company.<br>He mentioned that without attending class and communicating with classmates, he will never have developed the skills necessary to succeed in this way.</p>
<p>Secondly, attending classes help students to networking with like-minded people, which makes it easier to find jobs after their graduation.<br>As I said above, students are likely to talk to their classmates. This can not only help them become effective communicators but also assist them in forming relationships and friendships with classmates.<br>Again, my experience demonstrates the value of this.<br>Following my graduation, I was able to get recommendation from my classmates who had been hired by a prestigious firm. There are a lot of my friends in different cities. Before I chose where I worked in, they helped me to know about these cities and gave me suggestions.<br>Without their help, I would not have ability to decide where to work.</p>
<p>The Example Essay</p>
<p>(question taken from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>As online technology develops and ideas about learning change, there are many different opinions about whether it should still be mandatory for students to attend classes.  I am of the opinion that it remains important for students to physically attend their classes.  I will explore why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, being physically present in a class makes it more likely that a student will participate in conversation and debate, which will help him following his graduation.  A university education is not just about writing essays and getting grades, but rather it is about spending time in a stimulating academic environment.  It is very important for students to share their opinions with others both inside and out of the lecture hall, and even to engage in healthy debate with their professors.  Exchanges of this type shape young minds, and students who miss out on them do not get as much from their degree program as they ought to.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  I learned an enormous amount about effective communication by participating in classroom discussions as an undergraduate.  Moreover, classroom discussion showed me how to support my opinions with facts, and also how to remain polite when talking with others.  My finely honed communication skills were very useful when it came time for me to find professional employment</p>
<p>Furthermore, attending classes helps students to network with like-minded people, which also makes it easier to find jobs following their graduation.  As I said above, students are likely to talk to their classmates during lectures.  This not only helps them to become effective communicators, but also assists them in forming relationships and friendships with their peers.  Again, my experience demonstrates the value of this.  Following my graduation,  I was able to get recommendations and referrals from classmates who had already been hired by prestigious firms.  My insider connections were critical when it came to landing job interviews and eventual employment.  Had I not developed close relationships with my peers I would not have had this valuable resource.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is still very important for students to attend classes.  This is because doing so helps them to perfect their communication skills, and because the opportunities for networking that it provides are extremely valuable.</p>

        <p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:  in twenty years there will be fewer cars on the road than there are today.</p>
<p>Sample Essay</p>
<p>While in twenty years there may be fewer cars on the road in my country, the rest of the world will tell a different story. In my opinion, on a global scale, twenty years from now there will be many more cars in use that there are today. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, the developing world is rapidly urbanizing, which means that more people than ever embark on a daily commute to their workplace. In the past, most people in developing countries engaged in subsistence labor near their home. In contrast, today people are more likely to live in an urban area. The apartment blocks that they inhabit are usually far from the factories where they work, which necessitates a daily commute. My friend Lee is a good example of such a person. All of his ancestors worked on rice farms in northern China. Occasionally they traveled short distances using pack animals, but for the most part lived out their entire lives within a five kilometer radius of their birthplace. Lee, on the other hand, moved to a city last year to work in a steel plant and drives almost thirty kilometers from his home to the factory every day. All of his co-workers do the same, which is a pretty big change compared to the past. I can see no indication that this trend will halt in the future. Indeed, it seems likely that even more people will share Lee’s experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, incomes are rising all over the world, which means that in the future automobiles will be affordable for even more people. In the past, owning a car was a privilege enjoyed only by those living in the developed world. Now, however, consumers in developing countries like China and India purchase millions of cars every year. My friend’s experience is also typical of this trend. At the moment Lee does not own his own car, but rather gets to work by carpooling with a neighbor. However, he dreams of owning a vehicle of his own. While it might make financial sense for him to continue carpooling or take public transportation, he views car ownership as symbol of affluence. Lee has even indicated to me that someday he hopes to own two cars, just like many people in the west.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am of the opinion that in the future there will be more vehicles on the road than there are today. This is because the world is rapidly urbanizing, and because rising incomes will open up even more markets for carmakers.</p>

        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</p>
<p>“Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children.”</p>
<p>Taken from volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. There is a lot of debate about whether life nowadays is easier and more comfortable than it was. In my opinion, life has never been as comfortable as it is right now. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, today people work fewer hours than they did when my grandparents were very young, which increases their leisure time and their overall happiness.<br>Today, almost all workers enjoy time off on the weekend. This gives them ample time to pursue their hobbies and explore what makes them happy. I feel that my own family’s history is a good example of this<br>Several years ago, when my grandparents began their careers, they worked six days a week.<br>In contrast, I work just five days a week.<br>As a result of my light workload, I have time for sorts of my hobbies, while my grandparents can only take up their interests after their retirement.<br>I truly believe that an excess of leisure time is the definition of living an “easy life.”</p>
<p>​Secondly, advanced kitchen appliances are ubiquitous these days, which make it easier for people to enjoy fulfilling and interesting lives.<br>when my grandparents were young, their typical kitchen was equipped with only a simple stove.<br>Today, it is easy to find a whole range of appliances such as microwaves, toaster ovens, mixers and so on.</p>
<p>I use them to quickly prepare my interesting new foods every night using recipes from all over the world.<br>While my grand parents ate good food, its preparation was often quite time-consuming and arduous.<br>and their meals were somewhat repetitive</p>
<p>文化设施。</p>
<p>City includes a vast number of academic and cultural facilities, which makes it easier for people to access.<br>When my grandparents were young, there was only one library which located far away from my grandparents’ home.<br>Today, a child who become interest in some of these facilities are able to go there everyday.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.<br>When I was young living in a city, my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend.<br>We attend book readings at local library, art openings at many of the galleries ,literary festivals during the summer.<br>As a result of attending these outings, I developed a very strong interest in artistic expression and decided to major in music at university.<br>without these ample facilities, I would never have made these decisions.</p>

        <p>#Question<br>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“People learn things better from those at their own level - such as fellow students or co-workers - than from those at a higher level, such as teachers or supervisors.”</p>
<p>To begin with, people above us with a lot of maturity and experience can teach us more than people at our level. Young people, who have little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, are able to weigh their options and consider all the factors, such as results and effects. Therefore, it is important for us to seek instructions from people at a higher level. My own experience demonstrates the importance of it. Several years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I have difficulties with my math assignments, I sought help from my classmates and they gave me various answers. Still I had doubts about these answers. In desperation, I consulted my professor. He had the experience and expertise to provide me a compelling solution. As a result, I developed a strong interest in this class. Without his help, I would never have figured out the solution of my assignments.</p>
<p>Secondly, people who are above up are more likely to have more educational experience, which means they can efficiently and effectively convey lessons and instructions. Young people who are bright and a master of expertise may be unable to teach others if they lack the knowledge of how to convey information to beginners.<br>Also my own example can illustrate this.<br>Several years ago, I have difficulty in my math. My friend, Jason, excelled in all of classes and achieve impressive grades in math. So I seek assistance from him.<br>After a long time, he was unable to help me understand even the most basic topics.<br>In desperation, I asked my professor for help. To my surprise, he was able to correct my misunderstandings after only half an hour of conversation. </p>

        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“A person should never make an important decision alone.”</p>
<p>Taken from Volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>Everyone have to make various decisions in their lives. Some likes to make decisions by himself, while others prefer making decisions with their friends. In my opinion, making decisions with others is better than doing alone. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better decisions than youngsters. Young people, who have very little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, will consider all of the factors and carefully weigh their options. Therefore, it is important for us to seek advice from others so that we are well informed and have the benefit of their perspective and experience. My own experience demonstrates this concept. Four years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I had difficulties deciding which classes to take in university, I consulted my teacher and advisor. They had the knowledge and expertise to help me determine which classes were the best one to take for my own career. As a result of attending these class, I developed a strong interest in the class, and decided to major in music at university. Without their advice, I might have chosen unsuitable courses.</p>
<p>#Sample essay<br>​Some people prefer to make all of their important decisions without first consulting with others. I, on the other hand, feel that we should never make important decisions on our own. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, while we might think our lives are unique there is always someone close to us that has been faced with the same decision. By consulting with someone who has made a similar decision in the past, we can more carefully weigh our options. For example, when I graduated from high school five years ago I was forced to decide whether I should enroll in either a trade school or a university. I knew that a trade school would lead to more reliable employment in the future, but I also knew that a university would provide a more stimulating intellectual environment. I did not think that my old-fashioned and practical-minded parents would have struggled with such a dilemma in their youth, but when I talked it out with my father I found out that despite his tendencies towards conservatism and practical ways, as a young man he had given consideration to studying the liberal arts. As we talked about his motivations and some of the regrets associated with his decision I was able to more fully consider all of my own options.          ​</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that when we make decisions alone, we are more likely to make rash and impulsive moves. Talking about a problem with another person takes time, and thus our decision making process is slowed down. For example, when I decided to buy a new car last year I made purchase the very same day that the idea popped into my head. It seemed like a good idea at the time – gas prices were low and there was plenty of parking available on campus. However, when I told one of my classmates about my purchase she reminded me that gas prices always shoot up when we least expect them to, and that parking was easy only to find at that time because it was summer vacation and fewer students were on campus. Had I talked about these issues before buying the car I might have reconsidered whether or not it was a good idea.</p>
<p>​In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is never a good idea to make decisions without first talking to someone about them. This is because there is always someone in our life who has had to deal with a similar situation, and because talking about our decisions prevents us from acting impulsively.</p>

<p>#The Question</p>
<p>Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>These days, people have lots of dining options. It is now possible to eat food at a fine restaurant serving food from all around the world or use modern technology to prepare food in the comfort of our own homes. In my opinion, I prefer eat at home rather than eat out.</p>
<p>healthier<br>在家吃更健康。尽管餐厅好吃，但是油多盐多。长时间下去 过度消耗这些东西会导致隐形疾病。在家吃，我可以控制量，尽量避免他们。     虽然我的菜不好吃，但是这不能避免我喜欢。而不是仅仅喜欢事物，我的快乐来源于做食物，以及我的健康思想。</p>
<p>Having diner at home is healthier than at restaurant. Although the food prepared at restaurant tastes great, it includes a lot of oil, salt and sugar.<br>Home cooked meals are healthier than meals from restaurants and I strongly value my health. While meals prepared at restaurants are certainly delicious, they include a lot of oil, salt and sugar. Over consumption of these ingredients have a profound negative effect on our health and can lead to chronic illnesses.<br>For example, my uncle was a merchant who is so busy that he has no time to prepare his meals by himself and he was forced to eat at restaurants everyday. Over a long period of time, he got overweight. After that, his wife realized this problem and cook healthy food for him according to a suggestion from a doctor. As a result, he got better and pointed out that had he continued eating out, he will have had to suffer from a variety of illnesses.</p>

        <p>#The Question:</p>
<p>“Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.”</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>地球被伤害<br>环境污染     人类活动产生了很多污染，破坏了环境natural environment。 This is the result of    工厂生产industrial development，汽车行驶，都产生了有毒的气体。           尽管我们努力限制排放，但是还是不能inevitable避免伤害环境因为生产生活需要。           这些污染将对我们的身体有害，长久之后我们将遭受呼吸疾病，人类活动伤害了地球。    举个例子，过去 我家乡曾今是个美丽的农村 有很多树木与动物。 2而现在造了很多工厂和公路。工厂排放出黑色的烟雾，特别难闻。我几乎不能呼吸，只能迁到其他城市。if without that</p>
<p>human activity has caused most of the pollution that is damaging the natural environment. This is the result of industrialization. Although human are trying to limit <em>the volume of emissions</em> around the world, it will inevitably cause serious environmental problems. These problems not only affect nature but also have a terrible effect on human health and, over a long period of time, we will suffer from a variety of illnesses. My own experience is a good example of this. In the past, I lived in an area of China with beautiful countryside and clean air and rivers. But recently, many factories and roads have been constructed in my hometown. <em>Then</em> black <em>disgusting</em> smoke is emitted from these factories and I had difficulty breathing. Eventually, my family <em>was forced to</em> move to another city because we couldn’t endure the air pollution <em>any longer</em>. without these serious air problems, I would <em>never have had to</em> leave my hometown where I had lived for twenty years.</p>
<p>Many species are going extinct because their habitats are being occupied by humans. Without any place to live, animals have no where to immigrate. Moreover, human beings eat them as food and take their fur to make clothes. As a result, their population is declining in a quick pace and more and more creatures will only be seen in zoos and monuments when our children are born. For example, when I was a kid living in a rural area, there was a wide variety of animals in my hometown. I heard lots of birds singing on trees and saw plenty of fish swimming in rivers. These days, trees are cut and rivers disappear because of construction of factories and buildings. </p>
<p>物种灭绝     很多动物开始灭绝，随着人们的活动。      这是因为动物的栖息地正在被人类的扩张所占据。在这种情况下他们无处可去，数量越来越少。<br>Most of problems are controlled by ourselves, some of them have the hope to be resolved in years.   We are finding the balance between the development and the protection of our Earth.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. I am of the opinion that humanity has had a mostly negative effect on the planet.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, <em>industrial development</em> has caused <em>major air pollution,</em> which has a <em>terrible effect</em> on human health.  Every week I hear news reports about how horrible air quality is in major cities all over the world.  Additionally, we often hear that chronic lung diseases are on the rise and that there is connection between these two trends.  I am reminded of the years I spent living in Beijing, China.  After having spent most of my life living in the Canadian countryside where the air is mostly clean, I immediately noticed the smog and pollution of big city China.  Within months I was suffering from a variety of respiratory illnesses and had difficulty breathing.  I spent quite a few afternoons at a local hospital being treated for various throat and lung infections.  A majority of the population of the Earth now resides in cities, and they often suffer from the consequences of industrial development.</p>
<p>Secondly, human development has lead to a massive accumulation of trash, which <em>spoils the natural beauty</em> of the planet.  While in the past products were often made of <em>biodegradable materials</em> like paper and wood, today most <em>manufactured goods</em> are made of plastic that never <em>breaks down</em>.  Such materials sometimes find their way into permanent landfills, but often they just end up as litter.  When I traveled to the island of Borneo last summer I was impressed by the beauty of the place, but I also noticed that the natural environment was marred by an accumulation of plastic bags and water bottles that were strewn everywhere.  Had I visited the island a century ago I would not have found it tainted in such a way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that human activity has made the planet a less pleasant place to live.  This is because people are more likely to suffer from the effects of pollution than in the past, and because human waste has destroyed the natural beauty of our world.</p>

<p>These days, there is a lot of debate about where is a better place for children to grow up, a big city or a countryside. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. I am of the belief that life in urban areas is incomparably better for children than life in rural areas. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, young children who live in a big city are exposed to people from all walks of life which provides opportunities for networking. However, those kids growing in countrysides only communicate with few types of people. It is useful for youngsters to have friends from different walks of life because they will provide sudden opportunities to help young people find a satisfying job after their education. For example, My cousin grew in Beijing, which is the capital of China. He is willing to interact with people who speak a various languages and who have religious beliefs which are different from his own. Recently he found a business which provide him with a substantial income in the city he live. He co-found the business in a partnership with two friends he made in urban area. In contrast to my cousin’s success, children from small town have a limited set of contacts as their social circle expanded very little since their childhood.</p>
<p>Secondly, the two most important things in any child’s life are health and education. if children get sick in a rural area, there are no good hospitals to take them to. In contrast, kids growing in cities can easily access to advanced and careful treatment. Moreover, schools in the countryside are usually of low quality anyway, while children in large cities meet better teachers and receive high quality of education. For example, one of my friends grew in a urban city. The City include a vast number of academic and cultural facilities. His parents could easily take him to a cultural event almost every weekend. They attended book readings at local library, art openings at many galleries and literary festivals. As a result of attending these outings, he developed a strong interest in them. Now he enjoys a successful career as a artist. For this reason, I strongly believe that it is beneficial to grow in a city.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up in cities than in rural areas. This is because children from a big city have more opportunity to network, and because city can provide good health and education facilities..</p>
<p>#Sample Essay</p>
<p>There is no shortage of debate about whether it is better to raise children in a large city or in a small town. In my opinion, it is more advantageous to raise young people in an urban environment.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, cities include a vast number of academic and cultural facilities.  A child who visits such places on a regular basis will undoubtedly become very interested in some of them.  In addition, they will be able to make well-informed decisions about their future.  My own experience is a compelling example of this. When I was young I lived in a major urban area, so my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend.  We attended book readings at the local library, art openings at many of the galleries throughout the city, and literary festivals during the summer.  As a result of attending these outings I developed a strong interest in artistic expression, and decided to major in music at university.  Now I enjoy a successful career as a recording artist. For this reason, I strongly believe that it is beneficial to grow up in a large city.</p>
<p>Secondly, children who live in cities are exposed to people from many walks of life, while those in the countryside communicate with only one type of person.  Cities are usually magnets for new immigrants to my country, and are populated by individuals from many different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. It is useful for children to have friends who come from different walks of life.  For instance, my young cousin is growing up in New York, which is the largest city in my country.  She is still just a college student, but she is comfortable interacting with people who speak <em>a variety of languages</em>, and who have <em>religious beliefs</em> that are different from her own. Moreover, she recently mentioned that she was able to <em>find employment at a company looking for workers with an international perspective</em>.  Accordingly, I think that people who live in cities can enjoy a variety of beneficial interactions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up cities than in rural areas.  This is because cities are home to a variety of educational venues, and because they have very diverse and cosmopolitan populations.</p>
