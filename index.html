        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>What are some important qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.</p>
<p>People today spend an enormous amount of time at their workplace, and how much they enjoy that time depends largely on the attitude and attributes of their supervisor.  I am of the opinion that there are two main characteristics of a good boss, which are his experience and his professionalism.  I will explore these two factors in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, the amount of experience that our boss has is very important, because we are more likely to learn from a supervisor who is very experienced in their field.  Young people who are just starting out in their careers absorb new information like sponges, but even older workers can learn from those who have been around for a long time.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  When I began teaching ten years ago, my supervisor, Simon, had been working in education for more than ten years.  I was just out of college and knew very little about creating effective lesson plans, engaging students or even how to complete my paperwork.  Simon took the time to show me what he had learned over previous decade, and therefore I was soon able to keep up with my officemates.  In contrast, when I moved to a new school earlier this year, my supervisor actually had less experience teaching than I did.  Moreover, when I struggled with certain aspects of my job, he had very little to suggest that I did not already know.  As a result, my professional development stagnated.</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that the professionalism  is important for a boss, as it is essential to the maintenance of a good office environment.  My sister once told me that her first job following her graduation was difficult because of how toxic the office was.  Workers were prone to gossiping, shirking their duties and arriving late each day.  This was seen as acceptable because most of the supervisors in the firm behaved in the exact same way.  My sister was miserable, though, because she prides herself on her diligence and her ability to complete her tasks with care and enthusiasm.  This situation is a stark contrast to my experience with Simon, who I mentioned above.  He arrived early to the office each day, and never engaged in idle gossip about his officemates.  The people he supervised tried to do the same things.</p>

        <p>#question<br>In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon. Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of reasons why human life spans are longer than ever before.  In my opinion, there are two main reasons why people are living longer, which are improvements in medical technology and  working conditions. In the following essay, I will explore these two reasons in detail.</p>
<p>First of all, medical technology has developed in amazing ways, and can both prevent and cure many different illnesses.  Hundreds of diseases that might have killed us in the past can now be treated in safe and non-invasive ways.  Not only that, but technology can be used to identify potential illnesses even before they occur.  For example, I was told that my great-grandfather died of a heart attack when he was just forty-five years old, despite appearing outwardly healthy to his family.  However, thanks to modern medicine, I now know that males in my family are genetically predisposed to heart disease.  Thanks to this information I know to be extra-careful about my diet and when I exert myself.  When I am older I will begin taking blood thinning medicine as a preventive measure.  My great-grandfather did not have access to the predictive power of modern medicine and was not able to protect himself like I do today.</p>
<p>Secondly, improved working conditions help us live longer, as humans today have safer and less strenuous jobs than people in the past.  My great-grandfather was not the only male in my family to die at a young age, as his brother passed away when he was in his fifties.  His brother did not die from heart disease, but died from lung disease brought on by many years of working in a dirty coal mine.  The physical toll of his work and the dusty air he breathed every day caused him to develop cancer, which eventually claimed his life.  He was not the only person in his society to be killed by his job, as it was common for men and women to work in dangerous resource extraction jobs, or to put in twelve hour days at terribly unsafe factories.  People back then had neither safe working conditions nor effective safety equipment.  Modern workplace safety rules and regulations, however, prevent the same tragedies from happening today.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that people are living longer today for two main reasons.  They are that doctors have access to a wide range of technology to both cure and prevent illnesses, and because our jobs are safer and less taxing than in the past.</p>

        <p>The Question</p>
<p>Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.</p>
<p>Attending class physically makes it more likely that a student will participate in conversation and debate, which develop the skills necessary to work well in groups.<br>Many students arrive at school, very shy and unable to communicate well.<br>Communication and discussion in class teach students how to communicate efficiently. They can use this skill to excel in their future career.<br>My cousin’s example can demonstrate the importance of attending class.<br>Few years ago, When he started university, he was uncomfortable either speaking in front of crowds or working with others.<br>After four years of attending class, he became proficient at communication.<br>As a result, as he began his career after graduation, he excelled in group work and was seen by his co-worker and supervisors as a natural leader. He promoted quickly in the company.<br>He mentioned that without attending class and communicating with classmates, he will never have developed the skills necessary to succeed in this way.</p>
<p>Secondly, attending classes help students to networking with like-minded people, which makes it easier to find jobs after their graduation.<br>As I said above, students are likely to talk to their classmates. This can not only help them become effective communicators but also assist them in forming relationships and friendships with classmates.<br>Again, my experience demonstrates the value of this.<br>Following my graduation, I was able to get recommendation from my classmates who had been hired by a prestigious firm. There are a lot of my friends in different cities. Before I chose where I worked in, they helped me to know about these cities and gave me suggestions.<br>Without their help, I would not have ability to decide where to work.</p>
<p>The Example Essay</p>
<p>(question taken from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>As online technology develops and ideas about learning change, there are many different opinions about whether it should still be mandatory for students to attend classes.  I am of the opinion that it remains important for students to physically attend their classes.  I will explore why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, being physically present in a class makes it more likely that a student will participate in conversation and debate, which will help him following his graduation.  A university education is not just about writing essays and getting grades, but rather it is about spending time in a stimulating academic environment.  It is very important for students to share their opinions with others both inside and out of the lecture hall, and even to engage in healthy debate with their professors.  Exchanges of this type shape young minds, and students who miss out on them do not get as much from their degree program as they ought to.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  I learned an enormous amount about effective communication by participating in classroom discussions as an undergraduate.  Moreover, classroom discussion showed me how to support my opinions with facts, and also how to remain polite when talking with others.  My finely honed communication skills were very useful when it came time for me to find professional employment</p>
<p>Furthermore, attending classes helps students to network with like-minded people, which also makes it easier to find jobs following their graduation.  As I said above, students are likely to talk to their classmates during lectures.  This not only helps them to become effective communicators, but also assists them in forming relationships and friendships with their peers.  Again, my experience demonstrates the value of this.  Following my graduation,  I was able to get recommendations and referrals from classmates who had already been hired by prestigious firms.  My insider connections were critical when it came to landing job interviews and eventual employment.  Had I not developed close relationships with my peers I would not have had this valuable resource.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is still very important for students to attend classes.  This is because doing so helps them to perfect their communication skills, and because the opportunities for networking that it provides are extremely valuable.</p>

        <p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:  in twenty years there will be fewer cars on the road than there are today.</p>
<p>Sample Essay</p>
<p>While in twenty years there may be fewer cars on the road in my country, the rest of the world will tell a different story. In my opinion, on a global scale, twenty years from now there will be many more cars in use that there are today. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, the developing world is rapidly urbanizing, which means that more people than ever embark on a daily commute to their workplace. In the past, most people in developing countries engaged in subsistence labor near their home. In contrast, today people are more likely to live in an urban area. The apartment blocks that they inhabit are usually far from the factories where they work, which necessitates a daily commute. My friend Lee is a good example of such a person. All of his ancestors worked on rice farms in northern China. Occasionally they traveled short distances using pack animals, but for the most part lived out their entire lives within a five kilometer radius of their birthplace. Lee, on the other hand, moved to a city last year to work in a steel plant and drives almost thirty kilometers from his home to the factory every day. All of his co-workers do the same, which is a pretty big change compared to the past. I can see no indication that this trend will halt in the future. Indeed, it seems likely that even more people will share Lee’s experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, incomes are rising all over the world, which means that in the future automobiles will be affordable for even more people. In the past, owning a car was a privilege enjoyed only by those living in the developed world. Now, however, consumers in developing countries like China and India purchase millions of cars every year. My friend’s experience is also typical of this trend. At the moment Lee does not own his own car, but rather gets to work by carpooling with a neighbor. However, he dreams of owning a vehicle of his own. While it might make financial sense for him to continue carpooling or take public transportation, he views car ownership as symbol of affluence. Lee has even indicated to me that someday he hopes to own two cars, just like many people in the west.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am of the opinion that in the future there will be more vehicles on the road than there are today. This is because the world is rapidly urbanizing, and because rising incomes will open up even more markets for carmakers.</p>

        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</p>
<p>“Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children.”</p>
<p>Taken from volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. There is a lot of debate about whether life nowadays is easier and more comfortable than it was. In my opinion, life has never been as comfortable as it is right now. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, today people work fewer hours than they did when my grandparents were very young, which increases their leisure time and their overall happiness.<br>Today, almost all workers enjoy time off on the weekend. This gives them ample time to pursue their hobbies and explore what makes them happy. I feel that my own family’s history is a good example of this<br>Several years ago, when my grandparents began their careers, they worked six days a week.<br>In contrast, I work just five days a week.<br>As a result of my light workload, I have time for sorts of my hobbies, while my grandparents can only take up their interests after their retirement.<br>I truly believe that an excess of leisure time is the definition of living an “easy life.”</p>
<p>​Secondly, advanced kitchen appliances are ubiquitous these days, which make it easier for people to enjoy fulfilling and interesting lives.<br>when my grandparents were young, their typical kitchen was equipped with only a simple stove.<br>Today, it is easy to find a whole range of appliances such as microwaves, toaster ovens, mixers and so on.</p>
<p>I use them to quickly prepare my interesting new foods every night using recipes from all over the world.<br>While my grand parents ate good food, its preparation was often quite time-consuming and arduous.<br>and their meals were somewhat repetitive</p>
<p>文化设施。</p>
<p>City includes a vast number of academic and cultural facilities, which makes it easier for people to access.<br>When my grandparents were young, there was only one library which located far away from my grandparents’ home.<br>Today, a child who become interest in some of these facilities are able to go there everyday.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.<br>When I was young living in a city, my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend.<br>We attend book readings at local library, art openings at many of the galleries ,literary festivals during the summer.<br>As a result of attending these outings, I developed a very strong interest in artistic expression and decided to major in music at university.<br>without these ample facilities, I would never have made these decisions.</p>

        <p>#Question<br>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“People learn things better from those at their own level - such as fellow students or co-workers - than from those at a higher level, such as teachers or supervisors.”</p>
<p>To begin with, people above us with a lot of maturity and experience can teach us more than people at our level. Young people, who have little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, are able to weigh their options and consider all the factors, such as results and effects. Therefore, it is important for us to seek instructions from people at a higher level. My own experience demonstrates the importance of it. Several years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I have difficulties with my math assignments, I sought help from my classmates and they gave me various answers. Still I had doubts about these answers. In desperation, I consulted my professor. He had the experience and expertise to provide me a compelling solution. As a result, I developed a strong interest in this class. Without his help, I would never have figured out the solution of my assignments.</p>
<p>Secondly, people who are above up are more likely to have more educational experience, which means they can efficiently and effectively convey lessons and instructions. Young people who are bright and a master of expertise may be unable to teach others if they lack the knowledge of how to convey information to beginners.<br>Also my own example can illustrate this.<br>Several years ago, I have difficulty in my math. My friend, Jason, excelled in all of classes and achieve impressive grades in math. So I seek assistance from him.<br>After a long time, he was unable to help me understand even the most basic topics.<br>In desperation, I asked my professor for help. To my surprise, he was able to correct my misunderstandings after only half an hour of conversation. </p>
