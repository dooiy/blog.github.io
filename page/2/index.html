        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students’ sports activities as they give to their libraries. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>University libraries need more money to maintain their operation. These days there are plenty of employees who are sorting books and journals and are ready to provide assistance for students in the library. They need to be well paid. However, a sports team often only needs one coach for their training. In addition, masses of professional books which appear to cost a large amount of money are required to be purchased over short periods of time. For example, My university library is beautiful and offers many books for reference. When I forgot to return the book back to the shelf which I had just read, a worker would put it back on the shelf right away, which allow other students to find it easily. When I can’t find the book I want, I ask an employee for help and they are able to locate it for me. As a result, I had studied in the library efficiently with their help.</p>
<p>#Example Essay</p>
<p>Funding for athletic programs at colleges and universities is a very controversial issue these days.  Some people believe that universities should fund libraries and educational facilities rather than sports teams, while others feel that the opposite is true.  I am of the belief that universities should provide more funding for athletics.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>观点，these day摆事实。再换个说法说一遍观点    情况介绍，当他 他选择    这看起来很片面，但<br>To begin with, most universities <em>offer identical academic programs</em>, and are only able to <em>set themselves apart</em> from the crowd through the popularity of their sports teams.  These days there are hundreds of universities across the United States which are almost entirely interchangeable.  Only a <em>very select</em>  few Ivy League schools are known to be better than average.  It may seem somewhat arbitrary, but a sports team can help such middling schools <em>stand out from</em> the crowd and attract new students.  For example, my cousin is a very average student.  When he graduated from high school a few years ago, he chose to attend  California State College based solely on the fact that he loves basketball and that school is known for its on-court success.  This may seem superficial, but it mattered a lot to him, and according to recent surveys he is not the only student who chose to attend for this reason.  The college earned his loyalty as a result of <em>the care and attention it has paid to its athletic program.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, sports are very profitable and are a good source of revenue in today’s precarious economic times.  Schools across the nation are facing a funding crisis, but they still need to build facilities and dormitories for new students.  University sports are a huge business in America, and are even more popular than professional sports in a lot of areas.  These teams can generate money for their schools through corporate sponsorships, ticket sales, licensing and broadcast agreements.  These profits can then be used to pay for academic facilities, including libraries.  This type of operation does not always seem the most idealistic thing for a university to do, but it certainly is a pragmatic solution to some of the problems that schools face today.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that colleges should provide more funding to their sports teams than they do to their academic facilities.  This is because sports help universities stand out in a crowded market of schools, and because the profits they generate can be used to fund other programs.</p>

<p>Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of fellow students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer</p>
<p>#My Essay<br>独自学习还是与同学一起<br>独自学习好<br>理由一：安静不分心          独立学习给予了我们一个安静的环境，允许我们集中注意力。   与朋友一起学习，我们很难不讨论学习之外的东西（无意义的联系，make jokes）and as a result 我们分心了，效率也变低了。相反， 独自学习可以让我们集中注意力解决问题。这是因为我们可以想的更加全面。</p>
<p>理由二：独立解决问题，更能提升自己实力       独立学习可以帮助我们提高自己解决问题的能力。  很多同学在遇到困难的时候，很害怕而且很无助。这是因为他们经常从别人哪里获得帮助，从而丧失了自己思考的能力。 相反，在独自学习的时候，我们只能自己想办法解决难题，这强迫我们提高了自己的能力。在未来的职业生涯中，我们精通于处理问题，这让我们升职地很快。</p>
<p>everyone has their own prefered study methods, and all of them have their benefits. There is a constant debate about whether students should study on their own or study with their friends. In my opinion, Studying alone is better than studying in a group. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, studying alone provides us a quiet place, which allow us to concentrate on our assignments. This is because we are easily distract in group studying, regardless of whether we make firm plans. As a result, I heard about that many students studying in a group find out wasting time sitting together for their coming exams. On the other hand, when studying on their own, they focus on specific area of the subject that I am struggling with and thought carefully about it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, studying by ourselves can help us develop the ability to solve difficult problems on their own. Many youngsters become depression and helpless when confronting problems and this is because they are accustomed to ask for help from others. Studying alone force students to solve difficulties without other’s help and they can use this skill in their future careers.</p>
<p>#Sample Essay<br>Everyone has their own preferred study methods, and all of them have their benefits.  I am of the opinion that it is better to study alone than to study as part of a group.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, studying alone <em>allows me to focus on</em> specific areas of a subject <em>that I am struggling with</em>, rather than doing a broad overview of the class.  I always attend my classes and communicate <em>regularly</em> with my professors and teachers, <em>so</em> I am <em>constantly aware of</em> which topics I need to focus on when I study.  <em>When I study in a group,</em> everyone in the group has different needs, and the study session is required to touch on all of them.  As a freshman four years ago, I was not aware of this and <em>found myself</em> wasting my time studying in a group for an important European history exam.  I knew that I really needed to focus on religious history, <em>but sat uncomfortably through a group study session that</em> <strong>progressed through political, cultural, scientific, literary and artistic history</strong> before touching only briefly on the issue of religion.  As a result, I <strong>performed more poorly on the test</strong> than <strong>I would have if I had just studied alone</strong>.大一的时候，我不知道这个，然后发现我在浪费时间在团队准备历史考试。 我知道我应该集中于宗教历史，但是</p>
<p>Furthermore, I recognize that I am a very <em>social creature</em>, and this means that <em>when I study in a group</em> I am easily distracted.  I am not the only person who has this problem; many people will agree that they too desire to socialize rather than study when in a group of friends and classmates.  My example of studying for that European history class is a good example of this.  Not only did I <strong>suffer from the fact</strong> that the we only <strong>touched</strong> briefly on my problem area, but certain group members (including myself) were easily <strong>drawn off-topic</strong>.  We were quick to make jokes about the material <strong>being covered</strong>, or <strong>make tenuous and meaningless connections</strong> between those topics and our own lives.  Thankfully I have avoided this problem since then as I have decided to always study by myself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that studying alone is better than studying in a group.  This is because studying alone allows me to focus on the areas that I need to, and because it helps me to avoid  socializing when I should be studying.</p>

        <p>#The Question</p>
<p>People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, increased knowledge). Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>人们为什么要参加大学<br>理由一：更好的找工作    学习专业技能     高新企业多    获得文凭   社会认可<br>people who have a university degree will be able to get jobs more easily than those don’t. Individuals in possession of only a high school diploma are employed solely in very low paying and low-skilled fields.Our society is developing in a increasingly quick pace and professional knowledge is required in more and more companies. Universities are the best place to achieve these professional skills.</p>
<p>理由二：获得更多的见识 认识更多的人 了解其他地区的文化 学习不同的语言 出国留学</p>
<p>#The Sample Essay</p>
<p>(the question used here came from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>There are a plethora of reasons why students choose to attend university in this day and age.  In my opinion, the single most important reason is to achieve financial security in the future. I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, a university degree is required in order to be hired at even the most basic jobs these days.  Individuals in possession of only a high school diploma are employed solely in very low paying and low-skilled fields.  This fact is evident to young people all over the world right now, and I believe it makes them feel quite a lot of urgency regarding their educational qualifications.  This is demonstrated by the fact that in the past, when people with just a high school education could get <em>satisfying jobs,</em> enrollment at universities was much lower than today.  Moreover, my friends and I have noticed that recently it has even become necessary to have a graduate degree in order to begin a career; no longer is it possible to achieve professional success with just an undergraduate degree.  It seems that this trend will not reverse any time soon, and thus students will continue to consider their financial future when making decisions about what to do when they finish their secondary education.</p>
<p>Moreover, universities provide wonderful opportunities for networking which help young people find <em>high-paying jobs</em> following their graduation.  The unemployment rate has been quite high for most of the past decade and it is very difficult for even well-educated people to find employment.  Many experts argue that the people we meet in university play a large role in our long-term professional success.  For example, my brother recently founded a successful online business which has <em>provided him with a substantial income</em>.  He co-founded the business in a partnership with two like-minded students whom he met in a freshman computer science class.  <em>My brother often points out that</em> the <em>partnership</em> which he formed with his students was even more valuable than the degree that he was awarded four years later.  <em>In contrast to my brother’s success,</em> many of my friends who chose not to attend university have <em>a limited set of contacts</em> as their social circles <em>have expanded very little</em> since childhood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that young people choose to <em>enroll in</em> post-secondary education mostly in order to secure their financial future.  This is because <em>a university degree</em> is a prerequisite for employment <em>in the modern era</em> and because universities provide students with valuable opportunities for <em>networking</em>.</p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>电视摧毁了朋友与家人之间的交流了么<br>理由一：电视给了我们很多谈资   电视有很多精彩的节目，很多人观看   如果我们都看过，我们可以深入的交流讨论评价电视节目<br><code>\
理由二：电视给了我们与家人朋友在一起的机会   过去 我们各自有各自的娱乐活动， 经常不在一起。   现在，相反，全家人都很爱看电视，这是因为电影很符合很多人的口味   结果在休闲的时候，全家人经常一起看电视，互相聊天，促进了交流。</code></p>
<p>Sample<br>理由一：电视帮助我们有一个有意义的谈话help has。    过去，朋友们大多数谈论共性in common。  经常，人们生活在相当简单的生活，话题很有限the topics are limited because people live in a simple life。     现在相反 每个人可以享受激烈的讨论，他们在电视上看到的广泛的活动，世界大事 everyone can enjoy debate about affaires in the world  </p>
<p>理由二：</p>
<p>These days television plays an important role in our entertainment and almost everyone has their favorite sort of TV programmes. For this reason, there is a lot of debate about whether television has destroyed communication among friends and family. In my opinion, the advent of television has not had a negative effect on the communication. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Television actually provide us sorts of topics that friends can talk about. There are many fairly popular programmes on TV and if fiend and I have watched them, we are able to have a spirited debate and a deep review about them. As a result, many students in my class become intimate friends because they tend to be fond of a certain TV show. In contrast, those people who don’t watch TV have limited topic in common because they live in simple lives.</p>
<p>Television creates more opportunities for families to be together. In the past, my parents and I have our own h</p>
<p>#sample essay</p>
<p>These days there is a lot of debate about how television has destroyed communication between human beings.  However, I strongly believe that the advent of televised entertainment has not had a negative effect on interpersonal communication.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, I contend that television actually <em>helps</em> people to have more <em>meaningful</em> conversations.  In the past, people mostly talked about what they had in common.  <em>Often</em>, talk of this sort was quite limited <strong>because people lived fairly simple lives.</strong>  These days, <strong>in contrast</strong>, individuals can enjoy spirited discussions about <em>the wide array of current events and world affairs</em> <em>that they hear about on television</em> every day.  For example, I have a regular Friday lunch date with my work colleagues at a local restaurant.  We do talk about office affairs, but most of our conversations are about the wide world around us which we learn about from watching television.  We talk about everything from political developments in distant countries to sports results from entirely different continents.  I strongly believe that without television to supply us with topics, my colleagues and I would talk mainly about banal office gossip.我与同事有个约会，我们讨论公司事物，但我们大部分讨论从电视上得知的这个世界，从政治到体育结果 来自完全不同的洲</p>
<p>Secondly, I am of the opinion that television has mostly replaced solitary activities, rather than replacing interactions with others.  <em>It appears that</em> television has mainly replaced hobbies like reading and exercising.  My own experience is compelling evidence of this.  I grew up in a very rural area without access to stable television signals and as a result, I spent most of my free time reading books and magazines.  When I started university, however, I moved to a big city and suddenly had access to one hundred channels.  Almost immediately, watching shows and movies replaced reading as my primary hobby.  I now read almost no books, but as I indicated in the above paragraph I still have meaningful conversations with friends on a regular basis.（我在一个农村长大，没有电视信号。（and as a result）我大部分时间看书和杂志），当我开始了大学生活，我到了一个大城市，然后突然可以收到很多频道。几乎同时，看show跟电影取代了我原来的hobby。我现在不看电视了，但我仍然与我的朋友有交流。</p>
<p>In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that the advent of television has harmed communication between friends and family.  I feel this way because television supplies us with a variety of topics which we can discuss with our friends, and because television-watching has mostly replaced solitary hobbies  rather than social activities. </p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>背景：家庭教育越来越流行。父母相信他们可以做得更好</p>
<p>理由一：父母偏见。为什么偏见？觉得自己孩子聪明  怎么偏见了？ 教的太快  结果孩子有严重后果。<br>理由二：父母观点落后。为什么落后？离开学校都20年了？    怎么落后了？不知道互联网教育   结果让孩子跟不上学习。<br>parents are biased when it comes to their own children. They think their children are the smartest one in the world. As a result, they teach their children in a inappropriately quick pace and mistakenly assume that their kids will be able to keep up. Over a course of and entire school year, this can have serious consequences.<br><code>1.think 用 assume     2.当对象是孩子的时候用 When it comes to      3.a course of an entire school year 学年</code></p>
<p>These days, homeschooling is becoming a more and more popular alternative to traditional learning methods and many parents believe that they can do a better job than professional educators.  I, however, do not agree with the idea that parents are the best teachers.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>is becoming popular alternative to    and   parents believe</code></p>
<p>First of all, parents are biased when it comes to their own children.  To be specific, most parents think that their children are the smartest in the world.<code>简单句</code>  As a result, they often teach their children <strong>at an inappropriately quick pace</strong> and <strong>mistakenly</strong> <strong>assume</strong> that they will be able to <strong>keep up</strong>.<code>复合句and 第二句副词提前</code>  Over the course of <strong>an entire school year</strong> this can have serious consequences.  An old friend of mine is a good example of this.  <strong>Rather than attending the local public school,</strong> my friend was taught at home by his mother.<code>介绍基本情况</code>  His mother had good intentions, but she failed completely at teaching him math.  She made the assumption that her son was able to grasp the basic concepts right away and moved on immediately to advanced concepts that were a full two grade-levels above what he would have been learning at the public school.  <strong>When it came time for my friend to take the annual state-mandated competency tests</strong> he was wholly unprepared and he <strong>shocked his mom</strong> with a failing grade.  This example demonstrates that, indeed, parents are not always the best teachers.<br>首先，当对自己的孩子时，父母会有偏见。很多父母认为他们的孩子是最聪明的。认为他们跟得上。这有严重的后果。我一个老同学是个很好的例子。 <em>1.基本情况</em>：他不是在当地学校学习，而是在家跟妈妈学。<em>2.简介结果：</em> 他妈妈心是好的，但是她数学教学彻底失败了。<em>3.原因：</em> 她估计他的孩子可以很快的抓住基本概念，然后迅速转向高级的概念。而这些概念在当地学校需要高两级的同学才能理解。  <em>4.结果：</em> 当她参加每年的州里的比赛时，她获得了低分。这个例子告诉我们父母不总是最好的老师</p>
<p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern teaching methods and <strong>therefore</strong> use antiquated and ineffective methods to educate their children.  <strong>Parents have children at increasingly advanced ages nowadays and when it comes time to teach their children, they have been out of school for ten or twenty years.</strong> Professional teachers, <strong>in contrast,</strong> have time for professional development every year of their careers and work in a collaborative environment where experienced teachers are kept up to date by their younger colleagues.  This means that trained teachers excel at teaching children of all backgrounds, while parents struggle to teach their own children.  While my friend’s mother eventually overcame her difficulty teaching math to her son, the next year she had a lot of trouble motivating him to keep up with his language lessons.  She was proactive, though, and sought help from her local school board.  The officials at the board put her in touch with a young teacher from a nearby elementary school.

<p>In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea that parents are the best educators in their children’s lives.  This is because parents see their children with biased eyes and because professional teachers benefit from modern techniques and training.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>341 words<br>Our parents are the ones who teach us walk and run after we was born. Literally, they are our earliest teachers, but it is controversy to decide whether can do better than many normal teachers. In my opinion, parents are the best teachers. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, parents are more familiar with us than any teacher and easily they with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to give us more appropriate advice. Our teachers, who need to teach many children in class, have no time to find out the best way for each individuals to impart their knowledge. My own experience can demonstrate the importance of method of education. When I was in my high school, I spend a lot of time on my mathematics which I got lowest grade on. My teacher gave me a ton of suggestions, while none of them turned out to be useful. When I ask my dad for help, he immediately pointed out that I misunderstand some important meaning of the question. I progressed much more quickly with the help of my dad than I did while following my teacher’s advice.</p>
<p>Secondly, parents have much more time accompany with their children, and teachers are replaced once a year. It is difficult to develop a good habit because it needs a constant and long time. Our parents have enough opportunity and time urge us to form a good habit. For example, my cousin’s teacher told him to read English every morning and write a diary everyday. His parents help him stay focused and avoid distraction when studying everyday. After one year, he was accustomed to these habit and got things done spontaneously due to the effort of his parents. This demonstrates that their parents are the best teacher in their lives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that parents are the best teacher of their children. This is because they know their children well and because they have abundant time accompany their children.</p>
<h1 id="Imitation"><a href="#Imitation" class="headerlink" title="Imitation"></a>Imitation</h1><p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern educational methods and therefore use antiquated and ineffective methods to teach their children. <code>原因and therefore结果  避免了 直接parents are likely， because</code></p>
<p>parents have children at an increasingly age and when it came time to teach there children, they have been out of school for ten or even twenty years. Teachers, however, have time for professional development every year of their career and work in a collaborative environment where teachers keep up to date.</p>

2.做对比 in contrast 或者 on the other hand</code></p>
<p>理由二：生活中有紧急情况。  医疗破产，   没钱很丢人<br>叔叔生病，因为花钱导致要借钱，很丢人<br>Money concerns are a major cause of stress in the modern world as people struggle to decide if they should spend their money to satisfy immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns.  In my opinion, it is a much better idea to save money for the future.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better financial than youngsters.<br>Young people, who have very little life experience, are prone to spending their money on products and consumer goods that are mostly useless and which they soon tire of.  Older people, on the other hand, know which purchases will result in long-term happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.</p>
<p><code>When I was young, I spent a tremendous amount of money on video games and comic books.</code></p>
<p><code>When I **later** **enrolled in university**, I did not have much money left to pay for my tuition, and was forced to take out a significant number of student loans.</code></p>
<p>Moreover, life is full of unexpected emergencies which often take a significant financial toll on people.  I recently read a newspaper article which pointed out that seventy-five percent of all bankruptcies in the United States are the result of medical expenses. I am well aware that it is humiliating to lose our financial independence.  </p>
<p>For example, last year</p>
<p><code>my uncle suffered a major heart attack which required him to undergo very expensive bypass surgery.</code></p>
<p><strong>He avoided bankruptcy, <em>but</em> did have to ask his elderly parents for a loan to pay his bills.</strong></p>
<p><code>They, unlike him, resisted the urge to spend and saved money through their entire lives.</code></p>
<p><code>He felt extremely embarrassed about begging his parents for assistance, especially as he could have avoided the situation by emulating their frugal behavior.</code></p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost everyone enjoys buying what they want. Some like to spend money right after they earn it, while others prefer saving money for another time in the future. In my opinion, I think it is better to save money in the bank and plan for future. I feel this way <em>for</em> two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>people struggle to decide if they should spend money satisfying one&#39;s immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns</code></p>
<p>To begin with, having some money in the bank helps us deal with some of unplanned emergencies. As our lives are full with unpredictable emergencies, this money provides an important assistance during the time. If we spend all the money recklessly, we will suffer a lot in the future. My cousin’s experience demonstrates that this is true. Five years ago, he had a job in a busy city. When getting his salary in the first week of each month, he would spend all of it on what he want. Unfortunately, his mother got a very serious illness<code>suffered a illness</code> two years ago, which needed a large amount of money in order to operate<code>undergo an expensive surgery</code> a surgery. <code>He did not have much money left to pay for the surgery, and had to take much time to borrow a lot from his friends due to his unwise financial plan.</code> Without prompt treatment, the illness of his mother got more serious. These days he is much more <em>conservative</em> in his spending, and <strong>carefully</strong> consider all of his <em>expenses</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large amount of money we saved for a long time helps us do expensive things such as traveling and studying abroad. As tourism is more popular than ever, the hotel owner has charged increasingly for accommodation. It is so expensive that we need to save money for a long time. For example, when my sister and I planned to study abroad in America, we were surprised by the cost we need. Both of us worked and saved money in order to afford the tuition fee and rent. If I spend money without limit, I would not make it and have the courage to go foreign country. This demonstrates some of the benefits of saving money.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is preferable to saving money for sometime in the future. This is because this money help us to deal with some unplanned emergencies and because we can afford some expensive plan with this money.</p>

        <p>##The Question</p>
<p>Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).<br>旅游需要有人陪嘛？<br>理由一： 有人陪同比没人陪同更经济。 as随着旅游越来越普遍，旅馆开始收更高的住宿费。  单人房间现在已经不常见了，与一个人分享房间是个好办法。 不仅如此人们结伴而行更容易获得团购。</p>
<p>理由二：结伴而行更容易跟当地人交谈。   while当一个人的时候会被看作很恐慌，一对夫妇会被认为更容易让人亲近。</p>
<p>##Sample essay<br>These days, tourism is more popular than ever, and everyone has their own style of travel.  Some people like to take trips alone, while others like to travel with a companion.  Personally, I prefer to travel with a partner.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone.  As leisure travel has become more and more common, hotel operators have started to charge increasingly high costs for accommodation.  Single occupancy rates are fairly uncommon nowadays, so sharing a room with a companion is good way to cut accommodation costs in half.  Not only that, but people traveling in pairs have better access to package deals on tours, entrance fees and other activities.  My own experience demonstrates some of the financial benefits of going on a trip with a friend.  When my girlfriend and I traveled together through Peru last year we were able to rent an entire hotel room for less than the cost of both of us sleeping in a shared dorm.  Over the course of our one month trip, we saved several hundred dollars in this way.  As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plans and extend our trip for almost an entire week.  This example demonstrates some of the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Moreover, in my experience it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in a pair and this makes any trip much more rewarding.  While a lone stranger can be seen as intimidating, a traveling couple (particularly a mixed-gender couple) is often considered more approachable.  For example, when my girlfriend and I took the aforementioned South American trip last year we were often welcomed into people’s homes and businesses with open arms.  The people who invited us often pointed out that they were willing to do so because we looked so happy, friendly and cheerful spending time together.  The welcome that we experienced as a pair was in stark contrast to my earlier experiences as a single travel, when it was much harder form connections with locals.  While a single traveler may be quite kind and cheerful, this can be somewhat difficult to determine from a distance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I definitely prefer to travel with a companion rather than alone.  This is based on the financial benefits of doing so, and because traveling with a partner makes it easy to interact with local people.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Traveling is something I dreamed of since I was a child. When having a trip, people can have a friend with them or be alone. Both types have their own disadvantages and advantages. In my opinion, it is better to travel with a companion. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Tourism is more popular than ever and everyone has their own style of travel. Some people like to take trip alone, while others like to travel with a companion. Personally, I prefer travel with a partner. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone. As travel becomes more and more common, the hotel owner has charged increasingly high cost for accommodation. So sharing a room with our partner can cut accommodation cost in half. Not only that, people traveling with partners have better access to package deals on entrance fee, tours and other activities.<br>For example, last year, I have trip to Beijing with my best friend. Because a standard room in the hotel has two bed, we only need to order one for accommodation. On the way to the landscapes, we saved several hundred dollars in this way since one car is enough for us to get there. As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plan and extend our trip for another week.    This example demonstrates the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking a trip with a partner has more fun than traveling alone. one person who traveling alone may feel boring while traveling in pair make any trip rewarding. When traveling to a new place with a partner, I can be able to communicate and share happiness with each other. However, if I travel alone, I may feel lonely in a totally strange and new place. My example can demonstrate that this is true. In my high school, I travel to Japan on my own. The trip is so long that I feel bored on the plane. I have no idea of how to communicate with local people which made me feel lonely during the trip. In contrast, when my girlfriend and I travel <strong>together</strong> through Japan <strong>last year</strong> again, I feel very happy and excited. As a result of that, I am relaxed and enjoyable. This example demonstrates the importance of a companion for creating fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in pair and this make any trip more rewarding. <code>A lone stranger can be seen as intimidating while a traveling couple is often considered more approachable. 使用while作对比</code> . For example， when my girlfriend and I take a trip to Japan,</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that traveling with a companion is preferable than traveling alone. This is because having a partner on a trip helps to save money and because our trip are more excited.</p>

Which country would you like to visit? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).</p>
<p>#Sample Essay</p>
<p>Traveling the world is something I have dreamed about doing ever since I was a small child.  If I was given the choice of visiting a country of my choosing, I would definitely go to Peru.  There are two main reasons why I feel this way, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, Peru is a land of varied landscapes and I believe that getting in touch with nature is the best way to enjoy a vacation.  Peru is unique in that it contains a tropical rainforest, some of the highest mountains in the world and even pristine beaches – all within close proximity to each other.  Few countries offer easier access to such a plethora of natural wonders.  One similar country is the United States; I remember that when I traveled across that country several years I was struck by how many different natural environments I was able to experience.  I felt that seeing such scenes helped me really get to know America.  I think that I could have a similar experience in Peru and because that country is much smaller I would have an easier and more affordable vacation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Peru is attractive because it has an extremely varied national cuisine.  I have heard that Peruvian food has been influenced by quite a few sources, including Spanish settlers, local indigenous groups and recent immigrants from the rest of the continent.  Not only that, but visitors to Peru can choose from several different dining venues, ranging from chic modern restaurants to charming street vendors.  I feel that eating the food of a place is another great way to really get to know a society.  I recall that when I visited Japan during my last summer vacation I felt at one with the Japanese people when I visited a local sushi restaurant.  I am certain that I would enjoy a similar feeling dining in Peru which would make a visit to that country very worthwhile.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if I could visit any country in the world, I would choose to travel to Peru.  I feel this way because of Peru’s amazing natural environment and its tantalizingly varied national cuisine.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Independent-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Independent-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Independent Essay"></a>Sample Independent Essay</h1><p>Neighbours play an important role in our lives, and almost everyone in the world has at least one neighbor.  For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor.  In my opinion, a good neighbor is both supportive and respectful.  I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full of unplanned emergencies.  Oftentimes the people live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong.  For example, my family experienced a major house fire several years ago.  It was a traumatic experience as it happened in the middle of the night and we lost most of our belongings.  Though none of us suffered any injuries, we did experience a lot of emotional trauma.  Our situation was aided, however, by a compassionate neighbor who immediately called the fire department upon noticing the fire and who also provided us with clean clothes, food and a place to stay for the night.  This example demonstrates how important it is to have kind and supportive neighbors when an emergency happens.</p>
<p>Moreover, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him.  People view their home as a sort of sanctuary from the stressful modern world and if their neighbors do not respect this belief they will suffer a lot.  My own experience demonstrates this reality.   Five years ago, I lived alone in an apartment in a busy city.  My job at that time was extremely stressful and also physically draining.  After a day at work I wanted nothing more than to go home and unwind. However, the person living in the apartment above me played loud music all night which made it almost impossible for me to relax.  He had no respect for those around him and thought only of himself.  In contrast, the person who lives above my family today does not do this and though I have the same job, I am better able to deal with its difficulties.  This illustrates the value of having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that good neighbors are both supportive and respectful.  This is because such people can help us handle life’s unexpected emergencies and allow us to feel comfortable in our own homes.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost Everyone in the world has at least a neighbor and neighbor plays an important role in our lives. For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor. In my opinion, a good neighbor <strong>is both</strong> supportive and respective. I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full with unplanned emergencies. If our neighbor do not support us in these situations, we will not make it easily.<code>Oftentimes people who live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong</code> My own experience demonstrate this reality. Five years ago, I live with my parents in a rural county. One day, I forgot my home key in the apartment and my parents need to work very late. It is so chill and rainy that I have no idea where to go. However, My situation was added by a compassionate neighbor who invite me to her apartment upon finding me sitting in front of the door and who also providing me with food and a place to stay. This example illustrates the value of having a neighbor who help us in these unplanned situations.</p>
<p>secondly, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him. People view their home as a sanctuary from a stressful modern world. For example, I live alone in an apartment in a big city. My job at that time was extremely stressful. After a day at work, I want nothing more than went home and relax. However, the person living above me played loud music all the night which made me almost impossible to sleep. He has no respect of those living around him and thought only of himself. In contrast, the person who lives above me today doesn’t do this. <strong>When he wants to organize a party, he will ask me whether it will disturb me. Because we respect each other, we can be harmonious.</strong> The example demonstrates how important it is to having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>

However, I agree that <code>it is better to use</code> printed materials rather than Internet-based resources.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, printed materials such as books and articles are more reliable than online sources of information. <code>1.比较型</code> This is because websites can be edited by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they are <strong>qualified academics</strong>. <code>2.解释</code> As a result of this, articles in online encyclopedias often contain incorrect and <strong>biased information</strong>.  <code>3.结果</code>I have even heard that some people insert incorrect facts into online databases as a mischievous joke. <code>4.even 进一步解释</code> My own experience demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. <code>5.example</code> Two semesters ago, I was assigned a research paper in a freshman history class.  I cited data that I found on Wikipedia which turned out to be completely incorrect.  The information that I included in my essay was so hopelessly wrong that my professor spotted it immediately, causing me to fail the assignment and receive a fairly low grade in the class at the end of the semester.  If I had taken the time to compare what I had read online to a book or a scholarly article I would not have included it and not have received such a bad score in the class.</p>
<p>In addition, books are superior to online articles because they provide a greater depth of information.  Books are much longer than online articles, which makes them useful to learners of all ages.  Students who use printed resources when doing research also benefit from the meticulously curated bibliographical information which they include.  I have personally experienced some of these benefits during my time as an undergraduate student.  For example, when I wrote a paper last semester in a history class, <em>the very first book that I consulted contained</em> a long description of the both the underlying causes and long-term effects of the historical event I was writing about.  In contrast, most of the online articles that I consulted contained little more than facts and dates.  As a result of basing my research on the book rather than the articles, I was able to write an insightful and nuanced essay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that print resources are more useful than online resources.  This is because printed sources of information are less likely to be biased or error-prone, and because books provide a superior level of detail on most topics.<br>`sample essay:用纸质资料还是用网络资料<br>理由一：纸质可靠        原因：网络资料可以被任何人编辑  所以：网络资料不准确<br>结果：我进场听到很多人拿到网上错误的信息<br>理由二：书更深入        原因：书更长，有用  所以：学生从这些精心策划的书目获益   </p>
<p>my essay:<br>理由一：网上更新     原因：书从编写到发售需要很长时间    所以书的资料过时了<br>结果：我经常听到很多人引用过时的数据<br>理由二：查阅更方便   原因：书太多了，翻书插资料不方便，即使按学科分类了   互联网的搜索工具十分强大 可以很轻易的查到我们想要的内容      所以使用互联网资源更省时间`</p>
<h3 id="The-Question-1"><a href="#The-Question-1" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Doing research by referring to books or by searching the internet each has their own advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, using the internet to conducting the research is better than using printed resources. I feel this way in two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, the resources on the internet give students more up-to-date and more fresh information. Usually books in a library are renewed in a long time. They may not involve the recent accomplishment and survey which we need in our assignments. However, the websites of the government and some institute provide us accurate and new statistics. For example, I recently took a science class whose assignment is a research for the development of 3D printers which have a big evolution in last few years. There is few records in books when I search for the information in our library. But after I turn to the internet resources, I find a bunch of valuable information about how a 3D printer works and why it becomes popular nowadays. As a result, I finished the assignment well and get praise from my professor. I think I would not accomplished this by looking into printed materials in the library.</p>
<p>Secondly, when conducting research with our classmates, we can communicate and collaborate with each other though the internet. Doing researching in a group can accelerate the process effectively. However, it is inconvenient for group members to gather together to share the information they got in a room. With a lot of useful tools through the internet, we can communicate wherever and whenever we are. My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true. When he started university, he didn’t buy his own computer in his dorm. He needs to go to the meeting room with his classmates to communicate about their research everyday. After he has a laptop in the second semester, he can talk to his teammate through the internet just at his dorm.They can easily accomplish their assignments with the collaboration. He got a better grade and progressed a lot in the second semester. Without the efficient communication with his classmates through the internet, he would not succeed in this way by only using printed resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that using the internet are preferable to only using the printed resources. This is because the internet can provide more up-to-date and fresh information and because the efficient communication on computer through the internet saves a lot of time.</p>
