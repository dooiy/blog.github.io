        <p>##The Question</p>
<p>Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).<br>旅游需要有人陪嘛？<br>理由一： 有人陪同比没人陪同更经济。 as随着旅游越来越普遍，旅馆开始收更高的住宿费。  单人房间现在已经不常见了，与一个人分享房间是个好办法。 不仅如此人们结伴而行更容易获得团购。</p>
<p>理由二：结伴而行更容易跟当地人交谈。   while当一个人的时候会被看作很恐慌，一对夫妇会被认为更容易让人亲近。</p>
<p>##Sample essay<br>These days, tourism is more popular than ever, and everyone has their own style of travel.  Some people like to take trips alone, while others like to travel with a companion.  Personally, I prefer to travel with a partner.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone.  As leisure travel has become more and more common, hotel operators have started to charge increasingly high costs for accommodation.  Single occupancy rates are fairly uncommon nowadays, so sharing a room with a companion is good way to cut accommodation costs in half.  Not only that, but people traveling in pairs have better access to package deals on tours, entrance fees and other activities.  My own experience demonstrates some of the financial benefits of going on a trip with a friend.  When my girlfriend and I traveled together through Peru last year we were able to rent an entire hotel room for less than the cost of both of us sleeping in a shared dorm.  Over the course of our one month trip, we saved several hundred dollars in this way.  As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plans and extend our trip for almost an entire week.  This example demonstrates some of the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Moreover, in my experience it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in a pair and this makes any trip much more rewarding.  While a lone stranger can be seen as intimidating, a traveling couple (particularly a mixed-gender couple) is often considered more approachable.  For example, when my girlfriend and I took the aforementioned South American trip last year we were often welcomed into people’s homes and businesses with open arms.  The people who invited us often pointed out that they were willing to do so because we looked so happy, friendly and cheerful spending time together.  The welcome that we experienced as a pair was in stark contrast to my earlier experiences as a single travel, when it was much harder form connections with locals.  While a single traveler may be quite kind and cheerful, this can be somewhat difficult to determine from a distance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I definitely prefer to travel with a companion rather than alone.  This is based on the financial benefits of doing so, and because traveling with a partner makes it easy to interact with local people.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Traveling is something I dreamed of since I was a child. When having a trip, people can have a friend with them or be alone. Both types have their own disadvantages and advantages. In my opinion, it is better to travel with a companion. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Tourism is more popular than ever and everyone has their own style of travel. Some people like to take trip alone, while others like to travel with a companion. Personally, I prefer travel with a partner. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone. As travel becomes more and more common, the hotel owner has charged increasingly high cost for accommodation. So sharing a room with our partner can cut accommodation cost in half. Not only that, people traveling with partners have better access to package deals on entrance fee, tours and other activities.<br>For example, last year, I have trip to Beijing with my best friend. Because a standard room in the hotel has two bed, we only need to order one for accommodation. On the way to the landscapes, we saved several hundred dollars in this way since one car is enough for us to get there. As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plan and extend our trip for another week.    This example demonstrates the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking a trip with a partner has more fun than traveling alone. one person who traveling alone may feel boring while traveling in pair make any trip rewarding. When traveling to a new place with a partner, I can be able to communicate and share happiness with each other. However, if I travel alone, I may feel lonely in a totally strange and new place. My example can demonstrate that this is true. In my high school, I travel to Japan on my own. The trip is so long that I feel bored on the plane. I have no idea of how to communicate with local people which made me feel lonely during the trip. In contrast, when my girlfriend and I travel <strong>together</strong> through Japan <strong>last year</strong> again, I feel very happy and excited. As a result of that, I am relaxed and enjoyable. This example demonstrates the importance of a companion for creating fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in pair and this make any trip more rewarding. <code>A lone stranger can be seen as intimidating while a traveling couple is often considered more approachable. 使用while作对比</code> . For example， when my girlfriend and I take a trip to Japan,</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that traveling with a companion is preferable than traveling alone. This is because having a partner on a trip helps to save money and because our trip are more excited.</p>

Which country would you like to visit? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).</p>
<p>#Sample Essay</p>
<p>Traveling the world is something I have dreamed about doing ever since I was a small child.  If I was given the choice of visiting a country of my choosing, I would definitely go to Peru.  There are two main reasons why I feel this way, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, Peru is a land of varied landscapes and I believe that getting in touch with nature is the best way to enjoy a vacation.  Peru is unique in that it contains a tropical rainforest, some of the highest mountains in the world and even pristine beaches – all within close proximity to each other.  Few countries offer easier access to such a plethora of natural wonders.  One similar country is the United States; I remember that when I traveled across that country several years I was struck by how many different natural environments I was able to experience.  I felt that seeing such scenes helped me really get to know America.  I think that I could have a similar experience in Peru and because that country is much smaller I would have an easier and more affordable vacation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Peru is attractive because it has an extremely varied national cuisine.  I have heard that Peruvian food has been influenced by quite a few sources, including Spanish settlers, local indigenous groups and recent immigrants from the rest of the continent.  Not only that, but visitors to Peru can choose from several different dining venues, ranging from chic modern restaurants to charming street vendors.  I feel that eating the food of a place is another great way to really get to know a society.  I recall that when I visited Japan during my last summer vacation I felt at one with the Japanese people when I visited a local sushi restaurant.  I am certain that I would enjoy a similar feeling dining in Peru which would make a visit to that country very worthwhile.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if I could visit any country in the world, I would choose to travel to Peru.  I feel this way because of Peru’s amazing natural environment and its tantalizingly varied national cuisine.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Independent-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Independent-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Independent Essay"></a>Sample Independent Essay</h1><p>Neighbours play an important role in our lives, and almost everyone in the world has at least one neighbor.  For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor.  In my opinion, a good neighbor is both supportive and respectful.  I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full of unplanned emergencies.  Oftentimes the people live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong.  For example, my family experienced a major house fire several years ago.  It was a traumatic experience as it happened in the middle of the night and we lost most of our belongings.  Though none of us suffered any injuries, we did experience a lot of emotional trauma.  Our situation was aided, however, by a compassionate neighbor who immediately called the fire department upon noticing the fire and who also provided us with clean clothes, food and a place to stay for the night.  This example demonstrates how important it is to have kind and supportive neighbors when an emergency happens.</p>
<p>Moreover, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him.  People view their home as a sort of sanctuary from the stressful modern world and if their neighbors do not respect this belief they will suffer a lot.  My own experience demonstrates this reality.   Five years ago, I lived alone in an apartment in a busy city.  My job at that time was extremely stressful and also physically draining.  After a day at work I wanted nothing more than to go home and unwind. However, the person living in the apartment above me played loud music all night which made it almost impossible for me to relax.  He had no respect for those around him and thought only of himself.  In contrast, the person who lives above my family today does not do this and though I have the same job, I am better able to deal with its difficulties.  This illustrates the value of having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that good neighbors are both supportive and respectful.  This is because such people can help us handle life’s unexpected emergencies and allow us to feel comfortable in our own homes.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost Everyone in the world has at least a neighbor and neighbor plays an important role in our lives. For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor. In my opinion, a good neighbor <strong>is both</strong> supportive and respective. I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full with unplanned emergencies. If our neighbor do not support us in these situations, we will not make it easily.<code>Oftentimes people who live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong</code> My own experience demonstrate this reality. Five years ago, I live with my parents in a rural county. One day, I forgot my home key in the apartment and my parents need to work very late. It is so chill and rainy that I have no idea where to go. However, My situation was added by a compassionate neighbor who invite me to her apartment upon finding me sitting in front of the door and who also providing me with food and a place to stay. This example illustrates the value of having a neighbor who help us in these unplanned situations.</p>
<p>secondly, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him. People view their home as a sanctuary from a stressful modern world. For example, I live alone in an apartment in a big city. My job at that time was extremely stressful. After a day at work, I want nothing more than went home and relax. However, the person living above me played loud music all the night which made me almost impossible to sleep. He has no respect of those living around him and thought only of himself. In contrast, the person who lives above me today doesn’t do this. <strong>When he wants to organize a party, he will ask me whether it will disturb me. Because we respect each other, we can be harmonious.</strong> The example demonstrates how important it is to having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>

<h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h1><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>Secondly, online articles are superior to books because it is easier to search for certain information. Search engines on the internet are powerful and practical, which saves a lot of time for learners of all age. Books, on the other hand, even with systematic classification, are difficult to search for what we want. Specifically, when we require some details in a field, we have to search some books by pages. As a result, I get my assignments quickly with the benefit of online resources.<br>My own experience demonstrates the advantage of the online articles.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>When students do research for their class assignments they use both printed and online sources and both types have distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, I agree that <code>it is better to use</code> printed materials rather than Internet-based resources.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, printed materials such as books and articles are more reliable than online sources of information. <code>1.比较型</code> This is because websites can be edited by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they are <strong>qualified academics</strong>. <code>2.解释</code> As a result of this, articles in online encyclopedias often contain incorrect and <strong>biased information</strong>.  <code>3.结果</code>I have even heard that some people insert incorrect facts into online databases as a mischievous joke. <code>4.even 进一步解释</code> My own experience demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. <code>5.example</code> Two semesters ago, I was assigned a research paper in a freshman history class.  I cited data that I found on Wikipedia which turned out to be completely incorrect.  The information that I included in my essay was so hopelessly wrong that my professor spotted it immediately, causing me to fail the assignment and receive a fairly low grade in the class at the end of the semester.  If I had taken the time to compare what I had read online to a book or a scholarly article I would not have included it and not have received such a bad score in the class.</p>
<p>In addition, books are superior to online articles because they provide a greater depth of information.  Books are much longer than online articles, which makes them useful to learners of all ages.  Students who use printed resources when doing research also benefit from the meticulously curated bibliographical information which they include.  I have personally experienced some of these benefits during my time as an undergraduate student.  For example, when I wrote a paper last semester in a history class, <em>the very first book that I consulted contained</em> a long description of the both the underlying causes and long-term effects of the historical event I was writing about.  In contrast, most of the online articles that I consulted contained little more than facts and dates.  As a result of basing my research on the book rather than the articles, I was able to write an insightful and nuanced essay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that print resources are more useful than online resources.  This is because printed sources of information are less likely to be biased or error-prone, and because books provide a superior level of detail on most topics.<br>`sample essay:用纸质资料还是用网络资料<br>理由一：纸质可靠        原因：网络资料可以被任何人编辑  所以：网络资料不准确<br>结果：我进场听到很多人拿到网上错误的信息<br>理由二：书更深入        原因：书更长，有用  所以：学生从这些精心策划的书目获益   </p>
<p>my essay:<br>理由一：网上更新     原因：书从编写到发售需要很长时间    所以书的资料过时了<br>结果：我经常听到很多人引用过时的数据<br>理由二：查阅更方便   原因：书太多了，翻书插资料不方便，即使按学科分类了   互联网的搜索工具十分强大 可以很轻易的查到我们想要的内容      所以使用互联网资源更省时间`</p>
<h3 id="The-Question-1"><a href="#The-Question-1" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Doing research by referring to books or by searching the internet each has their own advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, using the internet to conducting the research is better than using printed resources. I feel this way in two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, the resources on the internet give students more up-to-date and more fresh information. Usually books in a library are renewed in a long time. They may not involve the recent accomplishment and survey which we need in our assignments. However, the websites of the government and some institute provide us accurate and new statistics. For example, I recently took a science class whose assignment is a research for the development of 3D printers which have a big evolution in last few years. There is few records in books when I search for the information in our library. But after I turn to the internet resources, I find a bunch of valuable information about how a 3D printer works and why it becomes popular nowadays. As a result, I finished the assignment well and get praise from my professor. I think I would not accomplished this by looking into printed materials in the library.</p>
<p>Secondly, when conducting research with our classmates, we can communicate and collaborate with each other though the internet. Doing researching in a group can accelerate the process effectively. However, it is inconvenient for group members to gather together to share the information they got in a room. With a lot of useful tools through the internet, we can communicate wherever and whenever we are. My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true. When he started university, he didn’t buy his own computer in his dorm. He needs to go to the meeting room with his classmates to communicate about their research everyday. After he has a laptop in the second semester, he can talk to his teammate through the internet just at his dorm.They can easily accomplish their assignments with the collaboration. He got a better grade and progressed a lot in the second semester. Without the efficient communication with his classmates through the internet, he would not succeed in this way by only using printed resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that using the internet are preferable to only using the printed resources. This is because the internet can provide more up-to-date and fresh information and because the efficient communication on computer through the internet saves a lot of time.</p>

In my opinion, classes with a lot of discussion are better than those without .I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, I feel that classes where <strong>I have the opportunity to speak</strong> help to develop my intellectual abilities.<br>Classes where the teacher does all of the talking are very passive, in my opinion. They mostly just <strong>involve</strong> the memorization of facts and details which do not help students in the long run.<br>On the other hand, I find that classes which involve a lot of debate and interaction <strong>create</strong> very intelligent students.<code>2.说正面</code><br>For example, I recently took a political science class that changed the way I think about the world. <strong>The cut and thrust of debate in the class</strong> <em>made me consider</em> where my political beliefs came from and if they were actually correct.  I came out of the class as a more flexible person and more open to new ideas than ever before.  I believe that I would not have developed in such a way by just listening to lectures.  This example demonstrates how valuable discussion-based classes can be.</p>
<p>Secondly, classes that involve a lot of discussion can help students develop the skills necessary to work well in groups.  Many freshman students arrive at university very shy and unable to communicate well. Discussions in class teach students how to communicate effectively, and they can use this skill to excel in their future careers.  My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true.  When he started university he was a very introverted person and did not enjoy either communicating or working with others.  However, after four years of participating in debates, discussions and presentations in his classes he became a very confident communicator.  As a result, when he began his career after graduation, he excelled in group work and was seen by his co-workers and supervisors as a natural leader.  He was promoted quickly and advanced through the ranks of his company.  Without participating in discussions with his professors and classmates he would not have developed the skills necessary to succeed in this way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I feel strongly that classes which are centered on discussions between professors and students are preferable to those in which the professor does all of the talking.  This is because such classes help students develop academically and because they teach students the skills that they need to find success in the future.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Class have different organization forms according to the existence of discussions and lectures which has caused a disagreement on public. Although some argue that class with full lectures gives students more information, I am in favor of the view that discussions play an important role in class.</p>
<p>To begin with, discussions in class can motivate the class to become more active. classes which teacher does all of the talking are tenuous and they mostly just involved the memorization of facts and details which do not help students in the long run  If a class is full of lectures, the class is likely to be boring. So students tend to be distract from what the professor say. Also, with no discussion the professor can not know whether his students have understand his lecture. Conversely, if there are some discussions between the professor and students, the students would be enthusiastic to communicate with the professor. The lecture which the professor address can be adjusted properly according to the students’ feedback. For example, in my math class, my teacher Jason allowed us to discuss the difficult part of his lecture. When he know that we confront some complex concepts, he would give a specific explanation about them right away. Even if we have a little bit misunderstanding, he would correct it in class. So we are willing to interact with him. I progressed much more quickly with the important discussions in class.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the discussion students bring more possible insights and ideas related to the topic professor said which will in turn help students fully understand the main point.</p>

How does this increase in the availability of information influence life in today’s world?”</p>
<p>信息易得，怎么影响生活<br>观点一：学习更轻松  互联网上有很多资源，对学习有很大帮助     这些资源新，让人感兴趣。  可以很容易的掌握知识      </p>

<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Everyone can dramatically easily surfing the Internet to get the information they want nowadays. In my opinion, this easy access to information has a deep influence in researching and entertainment.</p>
<p>To begin with, the availability of up-to-date professional information helps us to do research well. The information offered by some institute include some findings, professional survey, and achievements in particular field which gives us some background knowledge.  Without this information, we are likely to spend a lot of time on redundant work.<br><code>科研论文语聊积累</code><br>For example, when I was attempting to write an essay about a topic, I was easily get lost if I have little background knowledge. After getting information from the Internet, I can have a thorough understand of the topic. Additionally, a new</p>
<p>Secondly, we are able to listen to even all the music and watch large amount of movies through the Internet which means we can have recreation at home. In the past, there are only few films in the cinema. We need go out with our friends to watch a movie. These days, however, we can easily access to new films on the Internet at home. My own experience is a good example of this. When I want some music to relax, I just need to open the apple music APP, then plenty of music will play constantly. When I heard about a new movie, what I have to do is to sign in a movie website and enjoy it. I save a lot of time and money with the availability of the valuable information on the Internet.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways.  In my opinion, the most prominent effect of the Internet is that it has strengthened democracy.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, online investigative reporting <em>plays a major role in</em> exposing political corruption and keeping politicians honest.  <em>In the past,</em> there were only <em>a limited number of</em> news outlets and they often had deep connections to powerful politicians and were hesitant to criticize them. <em>These days, however,</em> there are many independent publications on the Internet that are willing to expose political misbehavior.  For example, an online magazine recently published a story revealing that the mayor of my hometown had taken bribes from a property developer.  The report was so detailed and well-researched that the mayor had no choice but to resign.  Although the evidence was not hard to locate, only this independent website was willing to write about it.  This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to strengthen democracy in the modern world.</p>
<p>Secondly, the free exchange of ideas found online <em>motivates</em> people to become politically active.  In countries all over the world, people use social networking sites to share their ideas and opinions.  <em>While in the past</em> people might have thought that they were alone in their beliefs, <em>they can now</em> realize that others share their ideas. My own experience demonstrates this concept.  <em>When I was a university student</em>, I learned that a municipal park near my residence <em>was going to be</em> demolished to make room for a parking lot.  <em>This bothered me</em> a lot because I enjoyed spending time in the park.  At first I thought that there was nothing that I, as an individual, could do to stop this from happening.  However, I later joined a Facebook group dedicated to opposing the plan.  When the members of the group learned how many people in the city loved the park we were happy to get together and enthusiastically protest in front of city hall until our voices were heard.  I think that finding each other on that Facebook group gave us the courage to actively protect our park.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has strengthened democracy in modern society.  This is because online investigative journalism <em>plays a big part</em> in keeping politicians honest, and because social networking sites encourage people to be politically active.</p>
<h1 id="revise"><a href="#revise" class="headerlink" title="revise"></a>revise</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways. In my opinion, the effect of the Internet is that it has changed the way we entertain and research.</p>
<p>To begin with, online movies plays a major role in recreation nowadays. In the past, there were  a limited films and they can only be accessed in a cinema. These days, however, majority of websites offers movies without charge. We are available to old and classic films which are hard to find in a cinema. For example， when I want to watch a classic movie named The Godfather, I have no choice but download from the Internet because it won’t played by a cinema. When I invite my friends to my house, we can watch as much movie as we want at home instead of going to a cinema. This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to change the way we enjoy movies.</p>
<p>Secondly, the internet is the major source for scholarly journals, current news and books which help us conduct research. Many reliable statistics, articles and other information can be found on government or educational websites, while in the past conducting research involved a trip to the library. My own experience demonstrates this concept. When I was a university freshmen, I was assigned to do a research related to an animal. At first, I went to the library and bookstores for valuable information. However, I later found that is time-consuming and I switch to get information from the Internet. A number of websites such as Goole and Yahoo offers information about any topic I desire. As a result, I accomplished the research quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has change our life dramatically in entertainment and research. This is because the Internet offers plenty of movies and because some educational websites contain a lot of useful information for research.</p>

Search engines on the internet are powerful and practical, which saves a lot of time for learners of all age. Books, on the other hand, even with systematic classification, are difficult to search for what we want. Specifically, when we require some details in a field, we have to search some books by pages. As a result, I get my assignments quickly with the benefit of online resources.<br>My own experience demonstrates the advantage of the online articles.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay-2"><a href="#Sample-Essay-2" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>When students <code>do research for their class assignments</code> they use both printed and online sources and both types have distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, I agree that <code>it is better to use</code> printed materials rather than Internet-based resources.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, printed materials such as books and articles are more reliable than online sources of information. <code>1.比较型</code> This is because websites can be edited by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they are <strong>qualified academics</strong>. <code>2.解释</code> As a result of this, articles in online encyclopedias often contain incorrect and <strong>biased information</strong>.  <code>3.结果</code>I have even heard that some people insert incorrect facts into online databases as a mischievous joke. <code>4.even 进一步解释</code> My own experience demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. <code>5.example</code> Two semesters ago, I was assigned a research paper in a freshman history class.  I cited data that I found on Wikipedia which turned out to be completely incorrect.  The information that I included in my essay was so hopelessly wrong that my professor spotted it immediately, causing me to fail the assignment and receive a fairly low grade in the class at the end of the semester.  If I had taken the time to compare what I had read online to a book or a scholarly article I would not have included it and not have received such a bad score in the class.</p>
<p>My own experience can demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. I was assigned with a research in a history class. I used the statistics on Wikipedia which turns out to be incorrect. As a result, I got an low grade and my teacher easily spot the mistakes I make. I think I would avoid that mistake by comparing the data from printed books with the internet.</p>
<p>In addition, books are superior to online articles because they provide a greater depth of information.  Books are much longer than online articles, which makes them useful to learners of all ages.  Students who use printed resources when doing research also benefit from the meticulously curated bibliographical information which they include.  I have personally experienced some of these benefits during my time as an undergraduate student.  For example, when I wrote a paper last semester in a history class, the very first book that I consulted contained a long description of the both the underlying causes and long-term effects of the historical event I was writing about.  In contrast, most of the online articles that I consulted contained little more than facts and dates.  As a result of basing my research on the book rather than the articles, I was able to write an insightful and nuanced essay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that print resources are more useful than online resources.  This is because printed sources of information are less likely to be biased or error-prone, and because books provide a superior level of detail on most topics.</p>
<h3 id="The-Question-2"><a href="#The-Question-2" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay-2"><a href="#My-Essay-2" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Doing research by referring to books or by searching the internet each has their own advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, using the internet to conducting the research is better than using printed resources. I feel this way in two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, the resources on the internet give students more up-to-date and more fresh information. Usually books in a library are renewed in a long time. They may not involve the recent accomplishment and survey which we need in our assignments. However, the websites of the government and some institute provide us accurate and new statistics. For example, I recently took a science class whose assignment is a research for the development of 3D printers which have a big evolution in last few years. There is few records in books when I search for the information in our library. But after I turn to the internet resources, I find a bunch of valuable information about how a 3D printer works and why it becomes popular nowadays. As a result, I finished the assignment well and get praise from my professor. I think I would not accomplished this by looking into printed materials in the library.<br><code>To begin with, online source of information are more up-to-date than printed materials such as books and articles. This is because a lot of time is required for professional books in order to be printed and published. It also takes a long time for libraries to select and purchase these printed materials. As a result, articles in universities&#39; libraries often contain old and antiquated information.</code></p>
<p>Secondly, when conducting research with our classmates, we can communicate and collaborate with each other though the internet. Doing researching in a group can accelerate the process effectively. However, it is inconvenient for group members to gather together to share the information they got in a room. With a lot of useful tools through the internet, we can communicate wherever and whenever we are. My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true. When he started university, he didn’t buy his own computer in his dorm. He needs to go to the meeting room with his classmates to communicate about their research everyday. After he has a laptop in the second semester, he can talk to his teammate through the internet just at his dorm.They can easily accomplish their assignments with the collaboration. He got a better grade and progressed a lot in the second semester. Without the efficient communication with his classmates through the internet, he would not succeed in this way by only using printed resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that using the internet are preferable to only using the printed resources. This is because the internet can provide more up-to-date and fresh information and because the efficient communication on computer through the internet saves a lot of time.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Independent-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Independent-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Independent Essay"></a>Sample Independent Essay</h1><p>Neighbours play an important role in our lives, and almost everyone in the world has at least one neighbor.  For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor.  In my opinion, a good neighbor is both supportive and respectful.  I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full of unplanned emergencies.  Oftentimes the people live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong.  For example, my family experienced a major house fire several years ago.  It was a traumatic experience as it happened in the middle of the night and we lost most of our belongings.  Though none of us suffered any injuries, we did experience a lot of emotional trauma.  Our situation was aided, however, by a compassionate neighbor who immediately called the fire department upon noticing the fire and who also provided us with clean clothes, food and a place to stay for the night.  This example demonstrates how important it is to have kind and supportive neighbors when an emergency happens.</p>
<p>Moreover, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him.  People view their home as a sort of sanctuary from the stressful modern world and if their neighbors do not respect this belief they will suffer a lot.  My own experience demonstrates this reality.   Five years ago, I lived alone in an apartment in a busy city.  My job at that time was extremely stressful and also physically draining.  After a day at work I wanted nothing more than to go home and unwind. However, the person living in the apartment above me played loud music all night which made it almost impossible for me to relax.  He had no respect for those around him and thought only of himself.  In contrast, the person who lives above my family today does not do this and though I have the same job, I am better able to deal with its difficulties.  This illustrates the value of having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that good neighbors are both supportive and respectful.  This is because such people can help us handle life’s unexpected emergencies and allow us to feel comfortable in our own homes.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost Everyone in the world has at least a neighbor and neighbor plays an important role in our lives. For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor. In my opinion, a good neighbor <strong>is both</strong> supportive and respective. I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full with unplanned emergencies. If our neighbor do not support us in these situations, we will not make it easily.<code>Oftentimes people who live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong</code> My own experience demonstrate this reality. Five years ago, I live with my parents in a rural county. One day, I forgot my home key in the apartment and my parents need to work very late. It is so chill and rainy that I have no idea where to go. However, My situation was added by a compassionate neighbor who invite me to her apartment upon finding me sitting in front of the door and who also providing me with food and a place to stay. This example illustrates the value of having a neighbor who help us in these unplanned situations.</p>
<p>secondly, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him. People view their home as a sanctuary from a stressful modern world. For example, I live alone in an apartment in a big city. My job at that time was extremely stressful. After a day at work, I want nothing more than went home and relax. However, the person living above me played loud music all the night which made me almost impossible to sleep. He has no respect of those living around him and thought only of himself. In contrast, the person who lives above me today doesn’t do this. <strong>When he wants to organize a party, he will ask me whether it will disturb me. Because we respect each other, we can be harmonious.</strong> The example demonstrates how important it is to having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>

Which country would you like to visit? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).</p>
<p>#Sample Essay</p>
<p>Traveling the world is something I have dreamed about doing ever since I was a small child.  If I was given the choice of visiting a country of my choosing, I would definitely go to Peru.  There are two main reasons why I feel this way, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, Peru is a land of varied landscapes and I believe that getting in touch with nature is the best way to enjoy a vacation.  Peru is unique in that it contains a tropical rainforest, some of the highest mountains in the world and even pristine beaches – all within close proximity to each other.  Few countries offer easier access to such a plethora of natural wonders.  One similar country is the United States; I remember that when I traveled across that country several years I was struck by how many different natural environments I was able to experience.  I felt that seeing such scenes helped me really get to know America.  I think that I could have a similar experience in Peru and because that country is much smaller I would have an easier and more affordable vacation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Peru is attractive because it has an extremely varied national cuisine.  I have heard that Peruvian food has been influenced by quite a few sources, including Spanish settlers, local indigenous groups and recent immigrants from the rest of the continent.  Not only that, but visitors to Peru can choose from several different dining venues, ranging from chic modern restaurants to charming street vendors.  I feel that eating the food of a place is another great way to really get to know a society.  I recall that when I visited Japan during my last summer vacation I felt at one with the Japanese people when I visited a local sushi restaurant.  I am certain that I would enjoy a similar feeling dining in Peru which would make a visit to that country very worthwhile.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if I could visit any country in the world, I would choose to travel to Peru.  I feel this way because of Peru’s amazing natural environment and its tantalizingly varied national cuisine.</p>

<p>Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).<br>旅游需要有人陪嘛？<br>理由一： 有人陪同比没人陪同更经济。 as随着旅游越来越普遍，旅馆开始收更高的住宿费。  单人房间现在已经不常见了，与一个人分享房间是个好办法。 不仅如此人们结伴而行更容易获得团购。</p>
<p>理由二：结伴而行更容易跟当地人交谈。   while当一个人的时候会被看作很恐慌，一对夫妇会被认为更容易让人亲近。</p>
<p>##Sample essay<br>These days, tourism is more popular than ever, and everyone has their own style of travel.  Some people like to take trips alone, while others like to travel with a companion.  Personally, I prefer to travel with a partner.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone.  As leisure travel has become more and more common, hotel operators have started to charge increasingly high costs for accommodation.  Single occupancy rates are fairly uncommon nowadays, so sharing a room with a companion is good way to cut accommodation costs in half.  Not only that, but people traveling in pairs have better access to package deals on tours, entrance fees and other activities.  My own experience demonstrates some of the financial benefits of going on a trip with a friend.  When my girlfriend and I traveled together through Peru last year we were able to rent an entire hotel room for less than the cost of both of us sleeping in a shared dorm.  Over the course of our one month trip, we saved several hundred dollars in this way.  As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plans and extend our trip for almost an entire week.  This example demonstrates some of the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Moreover, in my experience it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in a pair and this makes any trip much more rewarding.  While a lone stranger can be seen as intimidating, a traveling couple (particularly a mixed-gender couple) is often considered more approachable.  For example, when my girlfriend and I took the aforementioned South American trip last year we were often welcomed into people’s homes and businesses with open arms.  The people who invited us often pointed out that they were willing to do so because we looked so happy, friendly and cheerful spending time together.  The welcome that we experienced as a pair was in stark contrast to my earlier experiences as a single travel, when it was much harder form connections with locals.  While a single traveler may be quite kind and cheerful, this can be somewhat difficult to determine from a distance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I definitely prefer to travel with a companion rather than alone.  This is based on the financial benefits of doing so, and because traveling with a partner makes it easy to interact with local people.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay-1"><a href="#My-essay-1" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Traveling is something I dreamed of since I was a child. When having a trip, people can have a friend with them or be alone. Both types have their own disadvantages and advantages. In my opinion, it is better to travel with a companion. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Tourism is more popular than ever and everyone has their own style of travel. Some people like to take trip alone, while others like to travel with a companion. Personally, I prefer travel with a partner. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone. As travel becomes more and more common, the hotel owner has charged increasingly high cost for accommodation. So sharing a room with our partner can cut accommodation cost in half. Not only that, people traveling with partners have better access to package deals on entrance fee, tours and other activities.<br>For example, last year, I have trip to Beijing with my best friend. Because a standard room in the hotel has two bed, we only need to order one for accommodation. On the way to the landscapes, we saved several hundred dollars in this way since one car is enough for us to get there. As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plan and extend our trip for another week.    This example demonstrates the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking a trip with a partner has more fun than traveling alone. one person who traveling alone may feel boring while traveling in pair make any trip rewarding. When traveling to a new place with a partner, I can be able to communicate and share happiness with each other. However, if I travel alone, I may feel lonely in a totally strange and new place. My example can demonstrate that this is true. In my high school, I travel to Japan on my own. The trip is so long that I feel bored on the plane. I have no idea of how to communicate with local people which made me feel lonely during the trip. In contrast, when my girlfriend and I travel <strong>together</strong> through Japan <strong>last year</strong> again, I feel very happy and excited. As a result of that, I am relaxed and enjoyable. This example demonstrates the importance of a companion for creating fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in pair and this make any trip more rewarding. <code>A lone stranger can be seen as intimidating while a traveling couple is often considered more approachable. 使用while作对比</code> . For example， when my girlfriend and I take a trip to Japan,</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that traveling with a companion is preferable than traveling alone. This is because having a partner on a trip helps to save money and because our trip are more excited.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay-3"><a href="#Sample-Essay-3" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>题目：立刻花钱还是存钱 可以两个事物比较<br>理由一：有经验的人买东西理性。（年轻人花在没用的东西上）  买长期快乐的东西   小时候买东西 长大了没得花<br>people with a lot of maturity and experience make better financial decisions than youngsters. <em>可以直接说理由1，没总结</em><br><em>一套对比论证</em> young people, who have little life experience, are prone to spend their money on products and consumer goods that are mostly useless.<br>Older people, on the other hand, knows what will result in long-term happiness and satisfaction.<br><code>1.a lot of maturity成熟     life experience生活经验  make financial decision经济决策    youngsters年轻人young people
东西products and consumer goods   大多数的mostly     
2.做对比 in contrast 或者 on the other hand</code></p>
<p>理由二：生活中有紧急情况。  医疗破产，   没钱很丢人<br>叔叔生病，因为花钱导致要借钱，很丢人<br>Money concerns are a major cause of stress in the modern world as people struggle to decide if they should spend their money to satisfy immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns.  In my opinion, it is a much better idea to save money for the future.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better financial than youngsters.<br>Young people, who have very little life experience, are prone to spending their money on products and consumer goods that are mostly useless and which they soon tire of.  Older people, on the other hand, know which purchases will result in long-term happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.</p>
<p><code>When I was young, I spent a tremendous amount of money on video games and comic books.</code></p>
<p><code>When I **later** **enrolled in university**, I did not have much money left to pay for my tuition, and was forced to take out a significant number of student loans.</code></p>
<p>Moreover, life is full of unexpected emergencies which often take a significant financial toll on people.  I recently read a newspaper article which pointed out that seventy-five percent of all bankruptcies in the United States are the result of medical expenses. I am well aware that it is humiliating to lose our financial independence.  </p>
<p>For example, last year</p>
<p><code>my uncle suffered a major heart attack which required him to undergo very expensive bypass surgery.</code></p>
<p><strong>He avoided bankruptcy, <em>but</em> did have to ask his elderly parents for a loan to pay his bills.</strong></p>
<p><code>They, unlike him, resisted the urge to spend and saved money through their entire lives.</code></p>
<p><code>He felt extremely embarrassed about begging his parents for assistance, especially as he could have avoided the situation by emulating their frugal behavior.</code></p>
<h1 id="My-essay-2"><a href="#My-essay-2" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost everyone enjoys buying what they want. Some like to spend money right after they earn it, while others prefer saving money for another time in the future. In my opinion, I think it is better to save money in the bank and plan for future. I feel this way <em>for</em> two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>people struggle to decide if they should spend money satisfying one&#39;s immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns</code></p>
<p>To begin with, having some money in the bank helps us deal with some of unplanned emergencies. As our lives are full with these emergencies, this money provide important assistance during the time. If we spend all the money we earned right away, we will suffer a lot. My cousin’s experience demonstrates that this is true. Five years ago, he had a job in a busy city. When getting his salary in the first week of each month, he would spend all of it on what he had planned. Unfortunately, his mother got a very serious illness<code>suffered a illness</code> two years ago, which needed a large amount of money in order to operate<code>undergo an expensive surgery</code> a surgery. <code>He did not have much money left to pay for the surgery, and had to take much time to borrow a lot from his friends due to his unwise financial plan.</code> Without prompt treatment, the illness of his mother got more serious. These days he is much more <em>conservative</em> in his spending, and <strong>carefully</strong> consider all of his <em>expenses</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large amount of money we saved for a long time helps us do expensive things such as traveling and studying abroad. As tourism is more popular than ever, the hotel owner has charged increasingly for accommodation. It is so expensive that we need to save money for a long time. For example, when my sister and I planned to study abroad in America, we were surprised by the cost we need. Both of us worked and saved money in order to afford the tuition fee and rent. If I spend money without limit, I would not make it and have the courage to go foreign country. This demonstrates some of the benefits of saving money.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is preferable to saving money for sometime in the future. This is because this money help us to deal with some unplanned emergencies and because we can afford some expensive plan with this money.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay-4"><a href="#Sample-Essay-4" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>背景：家庭教育越来越流行。父母相信他们可以做得更好</p>
<p>理由一：父母偏见。为什么偏见？觉得自己孩子聪明  怎么偏见了？ 教的太快  结果孩子有严重后果。<br>理由二：父母观点落后。为什么落后？离开学校都20年了？    怎么落后了？不知道互联网教育   结果让孩子跟不上学习。<br>parents are biased when it comes to their own children. They think their children are the smartest one in the world. As a result, they teach their children in a inappropriately quick pace and mistakenly assume that their kids will be able to keep up.

<p>These days, homeschooling is becoming a more and more popular alternative to traditional learning methods and many parents believe that they can do a better job than professional educators.  I, however, do not agree with the idea that parents are the best teachers.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>is becoming popular alternative to    and   parents believe</code></p>
<p>First of all, parents are biased when it comes to their own children.  To be specific, most parents think that their children are the smartest in the world.<code>简单句</code>  As a result, they often teach their children <strong>at an inappropriately quick pace</strong> and <strong>mistakenly</strong> <strong>assume</strong> that they will be able to <strong>keep up</strong>.<code>复合句and 第二句副词提前</code>  Over the course of <strong>an entire school year</strong> this can have serious consequences.  An old friend of mine is a good example of this.  <strong>Rather than attending the local public school,</strong> my friend was taught at home by his mother.<code>介绍基本情况</code>  His mother had good intentions, but she failed completely at teaching him math.  She made the assumption that her son was able to grasp the basic concepts right away and moved on immediately to advanced concepts that were a full two grade-levels above what he would have been learning at the public school.  <strong>When it came time for my friend to take the annual state-mandated competency tests</strong> he was wholly unprepared and he <strong>shocked his mom</strong> with a failing grade.  This example demonstrates that, indeed, parents are not always the best teachers.<br>首先，当对自己的孩子时，父母会有偏见。很多父母认为他们的孩子是最聪明的。认为他们跟得上。这有严重的后果。我一个老同学是个很好的例子。 <em>1.基本情况</em>：他不是在当地学校学习，而是在家跟妈妈学。<em>2.简介结果：</em> 他妈妈心是好的，但是她数学教学彻底失败了。<em>3.原因：</em> 她估计他的孩子可以很快的抓住基本概念，然后迅速转向高级的概念。而这些概念在当地学校需要高两级的同学才能理解。  <em>4.结果：</em> 当她参加每年的州里的比赛时，她获得了低分。这个例子告诉我们父母不总是最好的老师</p>
<p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern teaching methods and <strong>therefore</strong> use antiquated and ineffective methods to educate their children.  <strong>Parents have children at increasingly advanced ages nowadays and when it comes time to teach their children, they have been out of school for ten or twenty years.</strong> Professional teachers, <strong>in contrast,</strong> have time for professional development every year of their careers and work in a collaborative environment where experienced teachers are kept up to date by their younger colleagues.  This means that trained teachers excel at teaching children of all backgrounds, while parents struggle to teach their own children.  While my friend’s mother eventually overcame her difficulty teaching math to her son, the next year she had a lot of trouble motivating him to keep up with his language lessons.  She was proactive, though, and sought help from her local school board.  The officials at the board put her in touch with a young teacher from a nearby elementary school.  That teacher showed her how to use the Internet to help her son find foreign-language resources more suited to his specific interests.  Until she got help from that young teacher, she had no idea that the Internet included a wealth of videos, music and games that she could utilize in her home classroom.<br>数学 math<br>我朋友的妈妈，第二年跟不上了</p>
<p>我朋友的妈妈克服苦难教孩子数学，但是第二年她就觉得跟上孩子的课程有难度了／力不从心／跟不上。她很积极，去学校寻求帮助。学校让他与一个任课老师沟通。老师给她演示了现在怎么使用internet去学习外语。  直到她从那个老师获得帮助，她才知道互联网很多视频 游戏 可以用来帮助她的家庭教育。</p>
<p>while my friend’s mother <em>eventually</em> overcame the difficulty teach <em>ing</em> her <em>son</em> math, the next year she had <em>a lot of</em> trouble <em>motivating her son</em> to keep up <em>with</em> the language lesson. She is proactive and sought help from the <em>local</em> school <em>broad</em>. The officials at school let her to communicate with a young teacher <em>from the nearby elementary school</em>. The teacher showed her how to use the internet to <em>find foreign-language resources more suited to his specific interests</em>. until she got help from that <em>young</em> teacher, she has no idea that the internet has a <em>wealth</em> of video <em>s</em> pictures and games <em>that she can utilize in her classroom</em><code>不断具体</code></p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea that parents are the best educators in their children’s lives.  This is because parents see their children with biased eyes and because professional teachers benefit from modern techniques and training.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay-3"><a href="#My-essay-3" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>341 words<br>Our parents are the ones who teach us walk and run after we was born. Literally, they are our earliest teachers, but it is controversy to decide whether can do better than many normal teachers. In my opinion, parents are the best teachers. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, parents are more familiar with us than any teacher and easily they with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to give us more appropriate advice. Our teachers, who need to teach many children in class, have no time to find out the best way for each individuals to impart their knowledge. My own experience can demonstrate the importance of method of education. When I was in my high school, I spend a lot of time on my mathematics which I got lowest grade on. My teacher gave me a ton of suggestions, while none of them turned out to be useful. When I ask my dad for help, he immediately pointed out that I misunderstand some important meaning of the question. I progressed much more quickly with the help of my dad than I did while following my teacher’s advice.</p>
<p>Secondly, parents have much more time accompany with their children, and teachers are replaced once a year. It is difficult to develop a good habit because it needs a constant and long time. Our parents have enough opportunity and time urge us to form a good habit. For example, my cousin’s teacher told him to read English every morning and write a diary everyday. His parents help him stay focused and avoid distraction when studying everyday. After one year, he was accustomed to these habit and got things done spontaneously due to the effort of his parents. This demonstrates that their parents are the best teacher in their lives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that parents are the best teacher of their children. This is because they know their children well and because they have abundant time accompany their children.</p>
<h1 id="Imitation"><a href="#Imitation" class="headerlink" title="Imitation"></a>Imitation</h1><p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern educational methods and therefore use antiquated and ineffective methods to teach their children. <code>原因and therefore结果  避免了 直接parents are likely， because</code></p>
<p>parents have children at an increasingly age and when it came time to teach there children, they have been out of school for ten or even twenty years. Teachers, however, have time for professional development every year of their career and work in a collaborative environment where teachers keep up to date.</p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>电视摧毁了朋友与家人之间的交流了么<br>理由一：电视给了我们很多谈资   电视有很多精彩的节目，很多人观看   如果我们都看过，我们可以深入的交流讨论评价电视节目<br><code>\
理由二：电视给了我们与家人朋友在一起的机会   过去 我们各自有各自的娱乐活动， 经常不在一起。   现在，相反，全家人都很爱看电视，这是因为电影很符合很多人的口味   结果在休闲的时候，全家人经常一起看电视，互相聊天，促进了交流。</code></p>

<p>理由二：</p>
<p>These days television plays an important role in our entertainment and almost everyone has their favorite sort of TV programmes. For this reason, there is a lot of debate about whether television has destroyed communication among friends and family. In my opinion, the advent of television has not had a negative effect on the communication. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Television actually provide us sorts of topics that friends can talk about. There are many fairly popular programmes on TV and if fiend and I have watched them, we are able to have a spirited debate and a deep review about them. As a result, many students in my class become intimate friends because they tend to be fond of a certain TV show. In contrast, those people who don’t watch TV have limited topic in common because they live in simple lives.</p>

<p>#sample essay</p>
<p> However, I strongly believe that the advent of televised entertainment has not had a negative effect on interpersonal communication.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, I contend that television actually <em>helps</em> people to have more <em>meaningful</em> conversations.  In the past, people mostly talked about what they had in common.  <em>Often</em>, talk of this sort was quite limited <strong>because people lived fairly simple lives.</strong>  These days, <strong>in contrast</strong>, individuals can enjoy spirited discussions about <em>the wide array of current events and world affairs</em> <em>that they hear about on television</em> every day.  For example, I have a regular Friday lunch date with my work colleagues at a local restaurant.  We do talk about office affairs, but most of our conversations are about the wide world around us which we learn about from watching television.  We talk about everything from political developments in distant countries to sports results from entirely different continents.  I strongly believe that without television to supply us with topics, my colleagues and I would talk mainly about banal office gossip.我与同事有个约会，我们讨论公司事物，但我们大部分讨论从电视上得知的这个世界，从政治到体育结果 来自完全不同的洲</p>
<p>Secondly, I am of the opinion that television has mostly replaced solitary activities, rather than replacing interactions with others.  <em>It appears that</em> television has mainly replaced hobbies like reading and exercising.  My own experience is compelling evidence of this.  I grew up in a very rural area without access to stable television signals and as a result, I spent most of my free time reading books and magazines.  When I started university, however, I moved to a big city and suddenly had access to one hundred channels.  Almost immediately, watching shows and movies replaced reading as my primary hobby.  I now read almost no books, but as I indicated in the above paragraph I still have meaningful conversations with friends on a regular basis.（我在一个农村长大，没有电视信号。（and as a result）我大部分时间看书和杂志），当我开始了大学生活，我到了一个大城市，然后突然可以收到很多频道。几乎同时，看show跟电影取代了我原来的hobby。我现在不看电视了，但我仍然与我的朋友有交流。</p>
<p>In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that the advent of television has harmed communication between friends and family.  I feel this way because television supplies us with a variety of topics which we can discuss with our friends, and because television-watching has mostly replaced solitary hobbies  rather than social activities.</p>

<p>理由二：获得更多的见识 认识更多的人 了解其他地区的文化 学习不同的语言 出国留学</p>
<p>#The Sample Essay</p>
<p>(the question used here came from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>There are a plethora of reasons why students choose to attend university in this day and age.  In my opinion, the single most important reason is to achieve financial security in the future. I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, a university degree is required in order to be hired at even the most basic jobs these days.  Individuals in possession of only a high school diploma are employed solely in very low paying and low-skilled fields.  This fact is evident to young people all over the world right now, and I believe it makes them feel quite a lot of urgency regarding their educational qualifications.  This is demonstrated by the fact that in the past, when people with just a high school education could get satisfying jobs, enrollment at universities was much lower than today.  Moreover, my friends and I have noticed that recently it has even become necessary to have a graduate degree in order to begin a career; no longer is it possible to achieve professional success with just an undergraduate degree.  It seems that this trend will not reverse any time soon, and thus students will continue to consider their financial future when making decisions about what to do when they finish their secondary education.</p>
<p>Moreover, universities provide wonderful opportunities for networking which help young people find high-paying jobs following their graduation.  The unemployment rate has been quite high for most of the past decade and it is very difficult for even well-educated people to find employment.  Many experts argue that the people we meet in university play a large role in our long-term professional success.  For example, my brother recently founded a successful online business which has provided him with a substantial income.  He co-founded the business in a partnership with two like-minded students whom he met in a freshman computer science class.  My brother often points out that the partnership which he formed with his students was even more valuable than the degree that he was awarded four years later.  In contrast to my brother’s success, many of my friends who chose not to attend university have a limited set of contacts as their social circles have expanded very little since childhood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that young people choose to enroll in post-secondary education mostly in order to secure their financial future.  This is because a university degree is a prerequisite for employment in the modern era and because universities provide students with valuable opportunities for networking.</p>

<p>Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of fellow students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer</p>
<p>#My Essay<br>独自学习还是与同学一起<br>独自学习好<br>理由一：安静不分心          独立学习给予了我们一个安静的环境，允许我们集中注意力。   与朋友一起学习，我们很难不讨论学习之外的东西（无意义的联系，make jokes）and as a result 我们分心了，效率也变低了。相反， 独自学习可以让我们集中注意力解决问题。这是因为我们可以想的更加全面。</p>
<p>理由二：独立解决问题，更能提升自己实力       独立学习可以帮助我们提高自己解决问题的能力。  很多同学在遇到困难的时候，很害怕而且很无助。这是因为他们经常从别人哪里获得帮助，从而丧失了自己思考的能力。 相反，在独自学习的时候，我们只能自己想办法解决难题，这强迫我们提高了自己的能力。在未来的职业生涯中，我们精通于处理问题，这让我们升职地很快。</p>
<p>everyone has their own preferred study methods, and all of them have their distinct benefits. There is a constant debate about whether students should study on their own or study with their friends. In my opinion, Studying alone is better than studying in a group. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, studying alone provides us a quiet place, which allow us to concentrate on our assignments. This is because we are easily drawn off-topic in group studying, regardless of whether or not we make firm plans. As a result, I heard about that many students studying in a group find out wasting time sitting together for their coming exams. On the other hand, when studying on their own, they focus on specific area of the subject that I am struggling with and thought carefully about it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, studying by ourselves can help us develop the ability to solve difficult problems on their own. Many youngsters become depression and helpless when confronting problems and this is because they are accustomed to seek assistance from others. Studying alone force students to solve difficulties without other’s help and then they are more likely to improve their skills of analyzing the cause and the effect of problems.</p>

<p>To begin with, studying alone <em>allows me to focus on</em> specific areas of a subject <em>that I am struggling with</em>, rather than doing a broad overview of the class.  I always attend my classes and communicate <em>regularly</em> with my professors and teachers, <em>so</em> I am <em>constantly aware of</em> which topics I need to focus on when I study.  <em>When I study in a group,</em> everyone in the group has different needs, and the study session is required to touch on all of them.  As a freshman four years ago, I was not aware of this and <em>found myself</em> wasting my time studying in a group for an important European history exam.  I knew that I really needed to focus on religious history, <em>but sat uncomfortably through a group study session that</em> <strong>progressed through political, cultural, scientific, literary and artistic history</strong> before touching only briefly on the issue of religion.  As a result, I <strong>performed more poorly on the test</strong> than <strong>I would have if I had just studied alone</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I recognize that I am a very <em>social creature</em>, and this means that <em>when I study in a group</em> I am easily distracted.  I am not the only person who has this problem; many people will agree that they too desire to socialize rather than study when in a group of friends and classmates.  My example of studying for that European history class is a good example of this.  Not only did I <strong>suffer from the fact</strong> that the we only <strong>touched</strong> briefly on my problem area, but certain group members (including myself) were easily <strong>drawn off-topic</strong>.  We were quick to make jokes about the material <strong>being covered</strong>, or <strong>make tenuous and meaningless connections</strong> between those topics and our own lives.  Thankfully I have avoided this problem since then as I have decided to always study by myself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that studying alone is better than studying in a group.  This is because studying alone allows me to focus on the areas that I need to, and because it helps me to avoid  socializing when I should be studying.</p>

<h2 id="tags-10"><a href="#tags-10" class="headerlink" title="tags:"></a>tags:</h2><p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students’ sports activities as they give to their libraries. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>University libraries need more money to maintain their operation. These days there are plenty of employees who are sorting books and journals and are ready to provide assistance for students in the library. They need to be well paid. However, a sports team often only needs one coach for their training. In addition, masses of professional books which appear to cost a large amount of money are required to be purchased over short periods of time. For example, My university library is beautiful and offers many books for reference. When I forgot to return the book back to the shelf which I had just read, a worker would put it back on the shelf right away, which allow other students to find it easily. When I can’t find the book I want, I ask an employee for help and they are able to locate it for me. As a result, I had studied in the library efficiently with their help.</p>
<p>#Example Essay</p>
<p>Funding for athletic programs at colleges and universities is a very controversial issue these days.  Some people believe that universities should fund libraries and educational facilities rather than sports teams, while others feel that the opposite is true.  I am of the belief that universities should provide more funding for athletics.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>观点，these day摆事实。再换个说法说一遍观点    情况介绍，当他 他选择    这看起来很片面，但<br>To begin with, most universities <em>offer identical academic programs</em>, and are only able to <em>set themselves apart</em> from the crowd through the popularity of their sports teams.  These days there are hundreds of universities across the United States which are almost entirely interchangeable.  Only a <em>very select</em>  few Ivy League schools are known to be better than average.  It may seem somewhat arbitrary, but a sports team can help such middling schools <em>stand out from</em> the crowd and attract new students.  For example, my cousin is a very average student.  When he graduated from high school a few years ago, he chose to attend  California State College based solely on the fact that he loves basketball and that school is known for its on-court success.  This may seem superficial, but it mattered a lot to him, and according to recent surveys he is not the only student who chose to attend for this reason.  The college earned his loyalty as a result of <em>the care and attention it has paid to its athletic program.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, sports are very profitable and are a good source of revenue in today’s precarious economic times.  Schools across the nation are facing a funding crisis, but they still need to build facilities and dormitories for new students.  University sports are a huge business in America, and are even more popular than professional sports in a lot of areas.  These teams can generate money for their schools through corporate sponsorships, ticket sales, licensing and broadcast agreements.  These profits can then be used to pay for academic facilities, including libraries.  This type of operation does not always seem the most idealistic thing for a university to do, but it certainly is a pragmatic solution to some of the problems that schools face today.</p>

<p>These days, there is a lot of debate about where is a better place for children to grow up, a big city or a countryside. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. I am of the belief that life in urban areas is incomparably better for children than life in rural areas. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, young children who live in a big city are exposed to people from all walks of life which provides opportunities for networking. However, those kids growing in countrysides only communicate with few types of people. It is useful for youngsters to have friends from different walks of life because they will provide sudden opportunities to help young people find a satisfying job after their education. For example, My cousin grew in Beijing, which is the capital of China. He is willing to interact with people who speak a various languages and who have religious beliefs which are different from his own. Recently he found a business which provide him with a substantial income in the city he live. He co-found the business in a partnership with two friends he made in urban area. In contrast to my cousin’s success, children from small town have a limited set of contacts as their social circle expanded very little since their childhood.</p>
<p>Secondly, the two most important things in any child’s life are health and education. if children get sick in a rural area, there are no good hospitals to take them to. In contrast, kids growing in cities can easily access to advanced and careful treatment. Moreover, schools in the countryside are usually of low quality anyway, while children in large cities meet better teachers and receive high quality of education. For example, one of my friends grew in a urban city. The City include a vast number of academic and cultural facilities. His parents could easily take him to a cultural event almost every weekend. They attended book readings at local library, art openings at many galleries and literary festivals. As a result of attending these outings, he developed a strong interest in them. Now he enjoys a successful career as a artist. For this reason, I strongly believe that it is beneficial to grow in a city.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up in cities than in rural areas. This is because children from a big city have more opportunity to network, and because city can provide good health and education facilities..</p>
<p>#Sample Essay</p>
<p>There is no shortage of debate about whether it is better to raise children in a large city or in a small town. In my opinion, it is more advantageous to raise young people in an urban environment.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, cities include a vast number of academic and cultural facilities.  A child who visits such places on a regular basis will undoubtedly become very interested in some of them.  In addition, they will be able to make well-informed decisions about their future.  My own experience is a compelling example of this. When I was young I lived in a major urban area, so my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend.  We attended book readings at the local library, art openings at many of the galleries throughout the city, and literary festivals during the summer.  As a result of attending these outings I developed a strong interest in artistic expression, and decided to major in music at university.  Now I enjoy a successful career as a recording artist. For this reason, I strongly believe that it is beneficial to grow up in a large city.</p>
<p>Secondly, children who live in cities are exposed to people from many walks of life, while those in the countryside communicate with only one type of person.  Cities are usually magnets for new immigrants to my country, and are populated by individuals from many different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. It is useful for children to have friends who come from different walks of life.  For instance, my young cousin is growing up in New York, which is the largest city in my country.  She is still just a college student, but she is comfortable interacting with people who speak <em>a variety of languages</em>, and who have <em>religious beliefs</em> that are different from her own. Moreover, she recently mentioned that she was able to <em>find employment at a company looking for workers with an international perspective</em>.  Accordingly, I think that people who live in cities can enjoy a variety of beneficial interactions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up cities than in rural areas.  This is because cities are home to a variety of educational venues, and because they have very diverse and cosmopolitan populations.</p>

<p>“Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.”</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>地球被伤害<br>环境污染     人类活动产生了很多污染，破坏了环境natural environment。 This is the result of    工厂生产industrial development，汽车行驶，都产生了有毒的气体。           尽管我们努力限制排放，但是还是不能inevitable避免伤害环境因为生产生活需要。           这些污染将对我们的身体有害，长久之后我们将遭受呼吸疾病，人类活动伤害了地球。    举个例子，过去 我家乡曾今是个美丽的农村 有很多树木与动物。 2而现在造了很多工厂和公路。工厂排放出黑色的烟雾，特别难闻。我几乎不能呼吸，只能迁到其他城市。if without that</p>
<p>human activity has caused most of the pollution that is damaging the natural environment. This is the result of industrialization. Although human are trying to limit <em>the volume of emissions</em> around the world, it will inevitably cause serious environmental problems. These problems not only affect nature but also have a terrible effect on human health and, over a long period of time, we will suffer from a variety of illnesses. My own experience is a good example of this. In the past, I lived in an area of China with beautiful countryside and clean air and rivers. But recently, many factories and roads have been constructed in my hometown. <em>Then</em> black <em>disgusting</em> smoke is emitted from these factories and I had difficulty breathing. Eventually, my family <em>was forced to</em> move to another city because we couldn’t endure the air pollution <em>any longer</em>. without these serious air problems, I would <em>never have had to</em> leave my hometown where I had lived for twenty years.</p>
<p>Many species are going extinct because their habitats are being occupied by humans. Without any place to live, animals have no where to immigrate. Moreover, human beings eat them as food and take their fur to make clothes. As a result, their population is declining in a quick pace and more and more creatures will only be seen in zoos and monuments when our children are born. For example, when I was a kid living in a rural area, there was a wide variety of animals in my hometown. I heard lots of birds singing on trees and saw plenty of fish swimming in rivers. These days, trees are cut and rivers disappear because of construction of factories and buildings.</p>
<p>物种灭绝     很多动物开始灭绝，随着人们的活动。      这是因为动物的栖息地正在被人类的扩张所占据。在这种情况下他们无处可去，数量越来越少。<br>Most of problems are controlled by ourselves, some of them have the hope to be resolved in years.   We are finding the balance between the development and the protection of our Earth.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. I am of the opinion that humanity has had a mostly negative effect on the planet.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, <em>industrial development</em> has caused <em>major air pollution,</em> which has a <em>terrible effect</em> on human health.  Every week I hear news reports about how horrible air quality is in major cities all over the world.  Additionally, we often hear that chronic lung diseases are on the rise and that there is connection between these two trends.  I am reminded of the years I spent living in Beijing, China.  After having spent most of my life living in the Canadian countryside where the air is mostly clean, I immediately noticed the smog and pollution of big city China.  Within months I was suffering from a variety of respiratory illnesses and had difficulty breathing.  I spent quite a few afternoons at a local hospital being treated for various throat and lung infections.  A majority of the population of the Earth now resides in cities, and they often suffer from the consequences of industrial development.</p>
<p>Secondly, human development has lead to a massive accumulation of trash, which <em>spoils the natural beauty</em> of the planet.  While in the past products were often made of <em>biodegradable materials</em> like paper and wood, today most <em>manufactured goods</em> are made of plastic that never <em>breaks down</em>.  Such materials sometimes find their way into permanent landfills, but often they just end up as litter.  When I traveled to the island of Borneo last summer I was impressed by the beauty of the place, but I also noticed that the natural environment was marred by an accumulation of plastic bags and water bottles that were strewn everywhere.  Had I visited the island a century ago I would not have found it tainted in such a way.</p>

<p>Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>These days, people have lots of dining options. It is now possible to eat food at a fine restaurant serving food from all around the world or use modern technology to prepare food in the comfort of our own homes. In my opinion, I prefer eat at home rather than eat out.</p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“A person should never make an important decision alone.”</p>
<p>Taken from Volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>Everyone have to make various decisions in their lives. Some likes to make decisions by himself, while others prefer making decisions with their friends. In my opinion, making decisions with others is better than doing alone. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better decisions than youngsters. Young people, who have very little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, will consider all of the factors and carefully weigh their options. Therefore, it is important for us to seek advice from others so that we are well informed and have the benefit of their perspective and experience. My own experience demonstrates this concept. Four years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I had difficulties deciding which classes to take in university, I consulted my teacher and advisor. They had the knowledge and expertise to help me determine which classes were the best one to take for my own career. As a result of attending these class, I developed a strong interest in the class, and decided to major in music at university. Without their advice, I might have chosen unsuitable courses.</p>
<p>#Sample essay<br>​Some people prefer to make all of their important decisions without first consulting with others. I, on the other hand, feel that we should never make important decisions on our own. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, while we might think our lives are unique there is always someone close to us that has been faced with the same decision. By consulting with someone who has made a similar decision in the past, we can more carefully weigh our options. For example, when I graduated from high school five years ago I was forced to decide whether I should enroll in either a trade school or a university. I knew that a trade school would lead to more reliable employment in the future, but I also knew that a university would provide a more stimulating intellectual environment. I did not think that my old-fashioned and practical-minded parents would have struggled with such a dilemma in their youth, but when I talked it out with my father I found out that despite his tendencies towards conservatism and practical ways, as a young man he had given consideration to studying the liberal arts. As we talked about his motivations and some of the regrets associated with his decision I was able to more fully consider all of my own options.          ​</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that when we make decisions alone, we are more likely to make rash and impulsive moves. Talking about a problem with another person takes time, and thus our decision making process is slowed down. For example, when I decided to buy a new car last year I made purchase the very same day that the idea popped into my head. It seemed like a good idea at the time – gas prices were low and there was plenty of parking available on campus. However, when I told one of my classmates about my purchase she reminded me that gas prices always shoot up when we least expect them to, and that parking was easy only to find at that time because it was summer vacation and fewer students were on campus. Had I talked about these issues before buying the car I might have reconsidered whether or not it was a good idea.</p>

<p>“People learn things better from those at their own level - such as fellow students or co-workers - than from those at a higher level, such as teachers or supervisors.”</p>
<p>To begin with, people above us with a lot of maturity and experience can teach us more than people at our level. Young people, who have little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, are able to weigh their options and consider all the factors, such as results and effects. Therefore, it is important for us to seek instructions from people at a higher level. My own experience demonstrates the importance of it. Several years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I have difficulties with my math assignments, I sought help from my classmates and they gave me various answers. Still I had doubts about these answers. In desperation, I consulted my professor. He had the experience and expertise to provide me a compelling solution. As a result, I developed a strong interest in this class. Without his help, I would never have figured out the solution of my assignments.</p>
<p>Secondly, people who are above up are more likely to have more educational experience, which means they can efficiently and effectively convey lessons and instructions.

<p>“Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children.”</p>
<p>Taken from volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. There is a lot of debate about whether life nowadays is easier and more comfortable than it was. In my opinion, life has never been as comfortable as it is right now. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, today people work fewer hours than they did when my grandparents were very young, which increases their leisure time and their overall happiness.<br>Today, almost all workers enjoy time off on the weekend. This gives them ample time to pursue their hobbies and explore what makes them happy. I feel that my own family’s history is a good example of this<br>Several years ago, when my grandparents began their careers, they worked six days a week.<br>In contrast, I work just five days a week.<br>As a result of my light workload, I have time for sorts of my hobbies, while my grandparents can only take up their interests after their retirement.<br>I truly believe that an excess of leisure time is the definition of living an “easy life.”</p>
<p>​Secondly, advanced kitchen appliances are ubiquitous these days, which make it easier for people to enjoy fulfilling and interesting lives.<br>when my grandparents were young, their typical kitchen was equipped with only a simple stove.<br>Today, it is easy to find a whole range of appliances such as microwaves, toaster ovens, mixers and so on.</p>
<p>I use them to quickly prepare my interesting new foods every night using recipes from all over the world.<br>While my grand parents ate good food, its preparation was often quite time-consuming and arduous.<br>and their meals were somewhat repetitive</p>

<p>Sample Essay</p>
<p>While in twenty years there may be fewer cars on the road in my country, the rest of the world will tell a different story. In my opinion, on a global scale, twenty years from now there will be many more cars in use that there are today. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, the developing world is rapidly urbanizing, which means that more people than ever embark on a daily commute to their workplace. In the past, most people in developing countries engaged in subsistence labor near their home. In contrast, today people are more likely to live in an urban area. The apartment blocks that they inhabit are usually far from the factories where they work, which necessitates a daily commute. My friend Lee is a good example of such a person. All of his ancestors worked on rice farms in northern China. Occasionally they traveled short distances using pack animals, but for the most part lived out their entire lives within a five kilometer radius of their birthplace. Lee, on the other hand, moved to a city last year to work in a steel plant and drives almost thirty kilometers from his home to the factory every day. All of his co-workers do the same, which is a pretty big change compared to the past. I can see no indication that this trend will halt in the future. Indeed, it seems likely that even more people will share Lee’s experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, incomes are rising all over the world, which means that in the future automobiles will be affordable for even more people. In the past, owning a car was a privilege enjoyed only by those living in the developed world. Now, however, consumers in developing countries like China and India purchase millions of cars every year. My friend’s experience is also typical of this trend. At the moment Lee does not own his own car, but rather gets to work by carpooling with a neighbor. However, he dreams of owning a vehicle of his own. While it might make financial sense for him to continue carpooling or take public transportation, he views car ownership as symbol of affluence. Lee has even indicated to me that someday he hopes to own two cars, just like many people in the west.</p>

<p>The Example Essay</p>
<p>(question taken from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>As online technology develops and ideas about learning change, there are many different opinions about whether it should still be mandatory for students to attend classes.  I am of the opinion that it remains important for students to physically attend their classes.  I will explore why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, being physically present in a class makes it more likely that a student will participate in conversation and debate, which will help him following his graduation.  A university education is not just about writing essays and getting grades, but rather it is about spending time in a stimulating academic environment.  It is very important for students to share their opinions with others both inside and out of the lecture hall, and even to engage in healthy debate with their professors.  Exchanges of this type shape young minds, and students who miss out on them do not get as much from their degree program as they ought to.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  I learned an enormous amount about effective communication by participating in classroom discussions as an undergraduate.  Moreover, classroom discussion showed me how to support my opinions with facts, and also how to remain polite when talking with others.  My finely honed communication skills were very useful when it came time for me to find professional employment</p>
<p>Furthermore, attending classes helps students to network with like-minded people, which also makes it easier to find jobs following their graduation.  As I said above, students are likely to talk to their classmates during lectures.  This not only helps them to become effective communicators, but also assists them in forming relationships and friendships with their peers.  Again, my experience demonstrates the value of this.  Following my graduation,  I was able to get recommendations and referrals from classmates who had already been hired by prestigious firms.  My insider connections were critical when it came to landing job interviews and eventual employment.  Had I not developed close relationships with my peers I would not have had this valuable resource.</p>

<h2 id="tags-19"><a href="#tags-19" class="headerlink" title="tags:"></a>tags:</h2><p>#question<br>In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon. Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of reasons why human life spans are longer than ever before.  In my opinion, there are two main reasons why people are living longer, which are improvements in medical technology and  working conditions. In the following essay, I will explore these two reasons in detail.</p>
<p>First of all, medical technology has developed in amazing ways, and can both prevent and cure many different illnesses.  Hundreds of diseases that might have killed us in the past can now be treated in safe and non-invasive ways.  Not only that, but technology can be used to identify potential illnesses even before they occur.  For example, I was told that my great-grandfather died of a heart attack when he was just forty-five years old, despite appearing outwardly healthy to his family.  However, thanks to modern medicine, I now know that males in my family are genetically predisposed to heart disease.  Thanks to this information I know to be extra-careful about my diet and when I exert myself.  When I am older I will begin taking blood thinning medicine as a preventive measure.  My great-grandfather did not have access to the predictive power of modern medicine and was not able to protect himself like I do today.</p>
<p>Secondly, improved working conditions help us live longer, as humans today have safer and less strenuous jobs than people in the past.  My great-grandfather was not the only male in my family to die at a young age, as his brother passed away when he was in his fifties.  His brother did not die from heart disease, but died from lung disease brought on by many years of working in a dirty coal mine.  The physical toll of his work and the dusty air he breathed every day caused him to develop cancer, which eventually claimed his life.  He was not the only person in his society to be killed by his job, as it was common for men and women to work in dangerous resource extraction jobs, or to put in twelve hour days at terribly unsafe factories.  People back then had neither safe working conditions nor effective safety equipment.  Modern workplace safety rules and regulations, however, prevent the same tragedies from happening today.</p>
<h2 id="In-conclusion-I-believe-that-people-are-living-longer-today-for-two-main-reasons-They-are-that-doctors-have-access-to-a-wide-range-of-technology-to-both-cure-and-prevent-illnesses-and-because-our-jobs-are-safer-and-less-taxing-than-in-the-past"><a href="#In-conclusion-I-believe-that-people-are-living-longer-today-for-two-main-reasons-They-are-that-doctors-have-access-to-a-wide-range-of-technology-to-both-cure-and-prevent-illnesses-and-because-our-jobs-are-safer-and-less-taxing-than-in-the-past" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion, I believe that people are living longer today for two main reasons.

<p>#The Question</p>
<p>What are some important qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.</p>
<p>People today spend an enormous amount of time at their workplace, and how much they enjoy that time depends largely on the attitude and attributes of their supervisor.  I am of the opinion that there are two main characteristics of a good boss, which are his experience and his professionalism.  I will explore these two factors in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, the amount of experience that our boss has is very important, because we are more likely to learn from a supervisor who is very experienced in their field.  Young people who are just starting out in their careers absorb new information like sponges, but even older workers can learn from those who have been around for a long time.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  When I began teaching ten years ago, my supervisor, Simon, had been working in education for more than ten years.  I was just out of college and knew very little about creating effective lesson plans, engaging students or even how to complete my paperwork.  Simon took the time to show me what he had learned over previous decade, and therefore I was soon able to keep up with my officemates.  In contrast, when I moved to a new school earlier this year, my supervisor actually had less experience teaching than I did.  Moreover, when I struggled with certain aspects of my job, he had very little to suggest that I did not already know.  As a result, my professional development stagnated.</p>

<p>Sample Essay</p>
<pre><code>Everyone has their own preferred study methods, and all of them have unique benefits.  I am of the opinion that it is better to study with a teacher than it is to study alone.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

To begin with, studying with a teacher helps students to stay focused and avoid distraction, which are two things that young people often struggle with.  Students today have a world of technological distractions right at their fingertips, including smartphones, social networking websites and satellite television.  Even when we make firm plans, it is difficult to stay focused on our studies when we can so easily consume some frivolous entertainment instead.  When I was attempting to learn English for the first time, my studies faltered because I pulled out my phone whenever I hit a difficult part in my exercise book.  When I switched to studying with a tutor, however, simple courtesy prevented me from using a phone in her presence.  Additionally, whenever I tried to begin some idle small talk in order to avoid hard work, she gently nudged me back to my important studies.  I progressed much more quickly with her than I did while studying on my own.

Furthermore, students have an inflated sense of their own ability and intelligence, which causes problems when they try to study alone.  Many people believe that with just a nice textbook they can master any topic on their own.  They are of the opinion that they can create a curriculum all by themselves and formulate their own study plan.  However, this is something that only trained experts are actually very good at.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  As I said, I began studying English all by myself.  I drew up complicated lesson plans and schedules that were supposed to predict my progress.  Sadly, I did not progress as quickly as I anticipated.  When I started studying with a tutor, she immediately assessed my needs and ability level and created a more realistic timeline for my studies.  As a result, I have been able to make realistic progress without feeling discouraged.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that studying with a teacher is better than studying alone. This is because teachers help us to avoid distractions, and because they can assist us in creating realistic goals and objectives for our learning.---

# The Question:

People do many different things to stay healthy. What do you do for good health? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.







Example Independent Essay:

(this question came from the Official Guide to the TOEFL, 4th Edition)

Maintaining our health is one of the most effective ways of ensuring that we live a long and happy life.  I do many things in order to stay fit, but the most important is maintaining a healthy diet.  There are two reasons why I think this is critically important, which I will explore in the following essay.

To begin with, eating healthy food prevents obesity, which is the cause of many very serious illnesses.  Obesity is debilitating all by itself, but it also causes patients to suffer from a variety of other illnesses, including diabetes, arthritis and heart disease.  It is important to be aware of this connection when making decisions about the food which we eat.  My eldest cousin is a compelling example of this.  While my cousin maintained a healthy weight throughout high school and university (despite eating a lot of unhealthy snacks and junk food), when he entered adulthood his metabolism changed and he began to rapidly gain weight.  My cousin is not a particularly self-conscious individual and was never bothered by how his weight gain affected his appearance, so he continued to eat an unhealthy diet.  However, he was eventually diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes which has had a profound effect on his quality of life.  As a result, he regrets not being more careful about his dietary choices.

Secondly, eating healthy food gives me a lot of energy, which keeps me effective in my personal and professional pursuits.  It is no secret that people who lack certain vitamins and nutrients do not have the energy necessary to complete even simple tasks.  I recall how when I was a university student I often skipped meals because I was quite busy studying.  As a result of not eating proper meals, I started to suffer from fatigue and lethargy. My grades began to drop because when it came time to write my tests I could barely keep my eyes open long enough to answer the questions.  Moreover, my  assignments were poorly done because my fatigue made me unable to keep up with deadlines.  The following year I was a bit more diligent about making healthy food choices and my grades quickly recovered.

In conclusion, the most important thing I do in order to stay healthy is maintain a nutritious diet.  This is because keeping a healthy diet prevents obesity and related diseases, and because it gives me the energy to keep up with my academic and professional requirements.---

The Question:

How do movies or television influence people’s behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.


Movies and television shows have became very important entertainment in the world nowadays.
We are watching them and influenced by them generally.
They have changed our  behavior in our way of socialization and entertainment.
I will explore them in the following essay.

To begin with, movies and television shows change our entertainment in the holiday.
In the past, people always go out with their friends to relax and books are extremely popular for young people to kill their time.
In contrast, today youngsters always watch TV shows or movies at home. It is more convenient way to recreate.
My experience is a good example of this.
When I was young, my friends always invite me to play chess or card games which I was interested in. My parents also bought many comic books for me.
Nowadays, many of my friends are fond of watching movies in the cinema and my family often watch TV together at home.
The invention of movies and television give us more interesting recreation and improve the qualities of our lives.







#sample essay

These days there is a lot of debate about how television has destroyed communication between human beings.  However, I strongly believe that the advent of televised entertainment has not had a negative effect on interpersonal communication.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

To begin with, I contend that television actually helps people to have more meaningful conversations.  In the past, people mostly talked about what they had in common.  Often, talk of this sort was quite limited because people lived fairly simple lives.  These days, in contrast, individuals can enjoy spirited discussions about the wide array of current events and world affairs that they hear about on television every day.  For example, I have a regular Friday lunch date with my work colleagues at a local restaurant.  We do talk about office affairs, but most of our conversations are about the wide world around us which we learn about from watching television.  We talk about everything from political developments in distant countries to sports results from entirely different continents.  I strongly believe that without television to supply us with topics, my colleagues and I would talk mainly about banal office gossip.

Secondly, I am of the opinion that television has mostly replaced solitary activities, rather than replacing interactions with others.  It appears that television has mainly replaced hobbies like reading and exercising.  My own experience is compelling evidence of this.  I grew up in a very rural area without access to stable television signals and as a result, I spent most of my free time reading books and magazines.  When I started university, however, I moved to a big city and suddenly had access to one hundred channels.  Almost immediately, watching shows and movies replaced reading as my primary hobby.  I now read almost no books, but as I indicated in the above paragraph I still have meaningful conversations with friends on a regular basis.

In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that the advent of television has harmed communication between friends and family.  I feel this way because television supplies us with a variety of topics which we can discuss with our friends, and because television-watching has mostly replaced solitary hobbies  rather than social activities.







Ever since the invention of film, movies and television have exerted a major influence on the way people behave.  In my opinion, the most noticeable way that such entertainment influences us is by providing role-models. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

First of all, films and television provide society with a lot of negative role-models, which too many people are willing to emulate.  These days, the so-called “anti-hero” is a big part of popular culture.  This is a type of character who acts badly towards other people, ignores the rules of society and is generally misanthropic in nature.  It is quite common for these characters to glorify excessive alcohol consumption and drug use.  For example, an old friend of mine from high school is a huge fan of characters like this.  While he started high school as a straight-A student, he later began to watch a lot of movies which gave him the impression that consuming vast quantities of illegal narcotics was amusing and desirable behavior.  My friend barely finished high school and is now unemployed and has few job prospects

On the other hand, filmed entertainment also provides people with a lot of positive role-models.  For people who desire to watch it, there is a tremendous amount of wholesome family entertainment being broadcast.  Programs like this showcase functioning, stable families.  They are not just traditional conservative families, but caring, loving people from many different backgrounds and beliefs.  My own family often takes inspiration from the parents and children we see on television in shows of this genre.  We are not always able to live up to the ideals presented to us, but they offer a positive influence on the way we behave every day.

In conclusion, I am of the opinion that television and movies influence the way we behave by providing role-models.  The type of role-models we might emulate, though, depends on what programs we choose to consume, as both positive and negative messages are being shown all the time.---

knowledge gained from books has a wider range than that gained from experience.
books involves nearly everything from philosophy to geography, while experience of individuals is limited by a certain range.
knowledge from books seem to have almost no limitation.
with nearly no expense at all.




knowledge we get from experience is much deeper and more comprehensive than that gained from books.
How to cope with current social trends, even how to most effectively organize our own minds can seldom be found thoroughly and comprehensively discussed in books.






There are many factories appearing around our communities. The advent of factories have distinct advantages and disadvantages.


a large firm would be able to create hundreds of jobs for local people, which provide them with fairly good salaries. They will be confident to make investments in their futures and therefore the local community will be further enriched.
the factory would have negative effect on local environment, particularly in regards to polluting the water and air.

These days, however, <strong>there are many independent publications on the Internet that are willing to expose political misbehavior.</strong>  For example, an online magazine recently published a story revealing that the mayor of my hometown had taken bribes from a property developer.  The report was so detailed and well-researched that the mayor had no choice but to resign.  Although the evidence was not hard to locate, only this independent website was willing to write about it.  This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to strengthen democracy in the modern world.</p>
<p>Secondly, the free exchange of ideas found online motivates people to become politically active.  In countries all over the world, people use social networking sites to share their ideas and opinions.  <strong>While in the past people might have thought that they were alone in their beliefs, they can now realize that others share their ideas.</strong> My own experience demonstrates this concept.  When I was a university student, I learned that a municipal park near my residence was going to be demolished to make room for a parking lot.  This bothered me a lot because I enjoyed spending time in the park.  At first I thought that there was nothing that I, as an individual, could do to stop this from happening.  However, I later joined a Facebook group dedicated to opposing the plan.  When the members of the group learned how many people in the city loved the park we were happy to get together and enthusiastically protest in front of city hall until our voices were heard.  I think that finding each other on that Facebook group gave us the courage to actively protect our park.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has strengthened democracy in modern society.  This is because online investigative journalism plays a big part in keeping politicians honest, and because social networking sites encourage people to be politically active.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Everyone can dramatically easily surfing the Internet to get the information they want nowadays. In my opinion, this easy access to information has a deep influence in researching and entertainment.</p>
<p>To begin with, the availability of up-to-date professional information helps us to do research well. The information offered by some institute include some findings, professional survey, and achievements in particular field which gives us some background knowledge.  Without this information, we are likely to spend a lot of time on redundant work.<br><code>科研论文语聊积累</code><br>For example, when I was attempting to write an essay about a topic, I was easily get lost if I have little background knowledge. After getting information from the Internet, I can have a thorough understand of the topic. Additionally, a new</p>
<p>Secondly, we are able to listen to even all the music and watch large amount of movies through the Internet which means we can have recreation at home. In the past, there are only few films in the cinema. We need go out with our friends to watch a movie. These days, however, we can easily access to new films on the Internet at home. My own experience is a good example of this. When I want some music to relax, I just need to open the apple music APP, then plenty of music will play constantly. When I heard about a new movie, what I have to do is to sign in a movie website and enjoy it. I save a lot of time and money with the availability of the valuable information on the Internet.</p>
<h1 id="revise"><a href="#revise" class="headerlink" title="revise"></a>revise</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways. In my opinion, the effect of the Internet is that it has changed the way we entertain and research.</p>
<p>To begin with, online movies plays a major role in recreation nowadays. In the past, there were  a limited films and they can only be accessed in a cinema. These days, however, majority of websites offers movies without charge. We are available to old and classic films which are hard to find in a cinema. For example， when I want to watch a classic movie named The Godfather, I have no choice but download from the Internet because it won’t played by a cinema. When I invite my friends to my house, we can watch as much movie as we want at home instead of going to a cinema. This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to change the way we enjoy movies.</p>
<p>Secondly, the internet is the major source for scholarly journals, current news and books which help us conduct research. Many reliable statistics, articles and other information can be found on government or educational websites, while in the past conducting research involved a trip to the library. My own experience demonstrates this concept. When I was a university freshmen, I was assigned to do a research related to an animal. At first, I went to the library and bookstores for valuable information. However, I later found that is time-consuming and I switch to get information from the Internet. A number of websites such as Goole and Yahoo offers information about any topic I desire. As a result, I accomplished the research quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has change our life dramatically in entertainment and research. This is because the Internet offers plenty of movies and because some educational websites contain a lot of useful information for research.</p>
