<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</p>
<p>“Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children.”</p>
<p>Taken from volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. There is a lot of debate about whether life nowadays is easier and more comfortable than it was. In my opinion, life has never been as comfortable as it is right now. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, today people work fewer hours than they did when my grandparents were very young, which increases their leisure time and their overall happiness.<br>Today, almost all workers enjoy time off on the weekend. This gives them ample time to pursue their hobbies and explore what makes them happy. I feel that my own family’s history is a good example of this<br>Several years ago, when my grandparents began their careers, they worked six days a week.<br>In contrast, I work just five days a week.<br>As a result of my light workload, I have time for sorts of my hobbies, while my grandparents can only take up their interests after their retirement.<br>I truly believe that an excess of leisure time is the definition of living an “easy life.”</p>
<p>​Secondly, advanced kitchen appliances are ubiquitous these days, which make it easier for people to enjoy fulfilling and interesting lives.<br>when my grandparents were young, their typical kitchen was equipped with only a simple stove.<br>Today, it is easy to find a whole range of appliances such as microwaves, toaster ovens, mixers and so on.</p>
<p>I use them to quickly prepare my interesting new foods every night using recipes from all over the world.<br>While my grand parents ate good food, its preparation was often quite time-consuming and arduous.<br>and their meals were somewhat repetitive</p>
<p>文化设施。</p>
<p>City includes a vast number of academic and cultural facilities, which makes it easier for people to access.<br>When my grandparents were young, there was only one library which located far away from my grandparents’ home.<br>Today, a child who become interest in some of these facilities are able to go there everyday.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.<br>When I was young living in a city, my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend.<br>We attend book readings at local library, art openings at many of the galleries ,literary festivals during the summer.<br>As a result of attending these outings, I developed a very strong interest in artistic expression and decided to major in music at university.<br>without these ample facilities, I would never have made these decisions.</p>
