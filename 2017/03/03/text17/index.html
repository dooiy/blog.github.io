        <p>#Question<br>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“People learn things better from those at their own level - such as fellow students or co-workers - than from those at a higher level, such as teachers or supervisors.”</p>
<p>To begin with, people above us with a lot of maturity and experience can teach us more than people at our level. Young people, who have little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, are able to weigh their options and consider all the factors, such as results and effects. Therefore, it is important for us to seek instructions from people at a higher level. My own experience demonstrates the importance of it. Several years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I have difficulties with my math assignments, I sought help from my classmates and they gave me various answers. Still I had doubts about these answers. In desperation, I consulted my professor. He had the experience and expertise to provide me a compelling solution. As a result, I developed a strong interest in this class. Without his help, I would never have figured out the solution of my assignments.</p>
<p>Secondly, people who are above up are more likely to have more educational experience, which means they can efficiently and effectively convey lessons and instructions. Young people who are bright and a master of expertise may be unable to teach others if they lack the knowledge of how to convey information to beginners.<br>Also my own example can illustrate this.<br>Several years ago, I have difficulty in my math. My friend, Jason, excelled in all of classes and achieve impressive grades in math. So I seek assistance from him.<br>After a long time, he was unable to help me understand even the most basic topics.<br>In desperation, I asked my professor for help. To my surprise, he was able to correct my misunderstandings after only half an hour of conversation. </p>
