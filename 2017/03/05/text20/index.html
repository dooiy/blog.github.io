        <p>The Question</p>
<p>Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.</p>
<p>Attending class physically makes it more likely that a student will participate in conversation and debate, which develop the skills necessary to work well in groups.<br>Many students arrive at school, very shy and unable to communicate well.<br>Communication and discussion in class teach students how to communicate efficiently. They can use this skill to excel in their future career.<br>My cousinâ€™s example can demonstrate the importance of attending class.<br>Few years ago, When he started university, he was uncomfortable either speaking in front of crowds or working with others.<br>After four years of attending class, he became proficient at communication.<br>As a result, as he began his career after graduation, he excelled in group work and was seen by his co-worker and supervisors as a natural leader. He promoted quickly in the company.<br>He mentioned that without attending class and communicating with classmates, he will never have developed the skills necessary to succeed in this way.</p>
<p>Secondly, attending classes help students to networking with like-minded people, which makes it easier to find jobs after their graduation.<br>As I said above, students are likely to talk to their classmates. This can not only help them become effective communicators but also assist them in forming relationships and friendships with classmates.<br>Again, my experience demonstrates the value of this.<br>Following my graduation, I was able to get recommendation from my classmates who had been hired by a prestigious firm. There are a lot of my friends in different cities. Before I chose where I worked in, they helped me to know about these cities and gave me suggestions.<br>Without their help, I would not have ability to decide where to work.</p>
<p>The Example Essay</p>
<p>(question taken from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>As online technology develops and ideas about learning change, there are many different opinions about whether it should still be mandatory for students to attend classes.  I am of the opinion that it remains important for students to physically attend their classes.  I will explore why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, being physically present in a class makes it more likely that a student will participate in conversation and debate, which will help him following his graduation.  A university education is not just about writing essays and getting grades, but rather it is about spending time in a stimulating academic environment.  It is very important for students to share their opinions with others both inside and out of the lecture hall, and even to engage in healthy debate with their professors.  Exchanges of this type shape young minds, and students who miss out on them do not get as much from their degree program as they ought to.  My own experience is a compelling example of this.  I learned an enormous amount about effective communication by participating in classroom discussions as an undergraduate.  Moreover, classroom discussion showed me how to support my opinions with facts, and also how to remain polite when talking with others.  My finely honed communication skills were very useful when it came time for me to find professional employment</p>
<p>Furthermore, attending classes helps students to network with like-minded people, which also makes it easier to find jobs following their graduation.  As I said above, students are likely to talk to their classmates during lectures.  This not only helps them to become effective communicators, but also assists them in forming relationships and friendships with their peers.  Again, my experience demonstrates the value of this.  Following my graduation,  I was able to get recommendations and referrals from classmates who had already been hired by prestigious firms.  My insider connections were critical when it came to landing job interviews and eventual employment.  Had I not developed close relationships with my peers I would not have had this valuable resource.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is still very important for students to attend classes.  This is because doing so helps them to perfect their communication skills, and because the opportunities for networking that it provides are extremely valuable.</p>
