<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“A person should never make an important decision alone.”</p>
<p>Taken from Volume 1 of the Official Test Collection.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>Everyone have to make various decisions in their lives. Some likes to make decisions by himself, while others prefer making decisions with their friends. In my opinion, making decisions with others is better than doing alone. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better decisions than youngsters. Young people, who have very little experience, are prone to make wrong decisions. Older people, on the other hand, will consider all of the factors and carefully weigh their options. Therefore, it is important for us to seek advice from others so that we are well informed and have the benefit of their perspective and experience. My own experience demonstrates this concept. Four years ago, I was a freshman in the university. When I had difficulties deciding which classes to take in university, I consulted my teacher and advisor. They had the knowledge and expertise to help me determine which classes were the best one to take for my own career. As a result of attending these class, I developed a strong interest in the class, and decided to major in music at university. Without their advice, I might have chosen unsuitable courses.</p>
<p>#Sample essay<br>​Some people prefer to make all of their important decisions without first consulting with others. I, on the other hand, feel that we should never make important decisions on our own. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, while we might think our lives are unique there is always someone close to us that has been faced with the same decision. By consulting with someone who has made a similar decision in the past, we can more carefully weigh our options. For example, when I graduated from high school five years ago I was forced to decide whether I should enroll in either a trade school or a university. I knew that a trade school would lead to more reliable employment in the future, but I also knew that a university would provide a more stimulating intellectual environment. I did not think that my old-fashioned and practical-minded parents would have struggled with such a dilemma in their youth, but when I talked it out with my father I found out that despite his tendencies towards conservatism and practical ways, as a young man he had given consideration to studying the liberal arts. As we talked about his motivations and some of the regrets associated with his decision I was able to more fully consider all of my own options.          ​</p>
<p>Secondly, I feel that when we make decisions alone, we are more likely to make rash and impulsive moves. Talking about a problem with another person takes time, and thus our decision making process is slowed down. For example, when I decided to buy a new car last year I made purchase the very same day that the idea popped into my head. It seemed like a good idea at the time – gas prices were low and there was plenty of parking available on campus. However, when I told one of my classmates about my purchase she reminded me that gas prices always shoot up when we least expect them to, and that parking was easy only to find at that time because it was summer vacation and fewer students were on campus. Had I talked about these issues before buying the car I might have reconsidered whether or not it was a good idea.</p>
<p>​In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is never a good idea to make decisions without first talking to someone about them. This is because there is always someone in our life who has had to deal with a similar situation, and because talking about our decisions prevents us from acting impulsively.</p>
