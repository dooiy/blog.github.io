<h1 id="Sample-Independent-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Independent-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Independent Essay"></a>Sample Independent Essay</h1><p>Neighbours play an important role in our lives, and almost everyone in the world has at least one neighbor.  For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor.  In my opinion, a good neighbor is both supportive and respectful.  I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full of unplanned emergencies.  Oftentimes the people live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong.  For example, my family experienced a major house fire several years ago.  It was a traumatic experience as it happened in the middle of the night and we lost most of our belongings.  Though none of us suffered any injuries, we did experience a lot of emotional trauma.  Our situation was aided, however, by a compassionate neighbor who immediately called the fire department upon noticing the fire and who also provided us with clean clothes, food and a place to stay for the night.  This example demonstrates how important it is to have kind and supportive neighbors when an emergency happens.</p>
<p>Moreover, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him.  People view their home as a sort of sanctuary from the stressful modern world and if their neighbors do not respect this belief they will suffer a lot.  My own experience demonstrates this reality.   Five years ago, I lived alone in an apartment in a busy city.  My job at that time was extremely stressful and also physically draining.  After a day at work I wanted nothing more than to go home and unwind. However, the person living in the apartment above me played loud music all night which made it almost impossible for me to relax.  He had no respect for those around him and thought only of himself.  In contrast, the person who lives above my family today does not do this and though I have the same job, I am better able to deal with its difficulties.  This illustrates the value of having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that good neighbors are both supportive and respectful.  This is because such people can help us handle life’s unexpected emergencies and allow us to feel comfortable in our own homes.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost Everyone in the world has at least a neighbor and neighbor plays an important role in our lives. For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor. In my opinion, a good neighbor <strong>is both</strong> supportive and respective. I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full with unplanned emergencies. If our neighbor do not support us in these situations, we will not make it easily. My own experience can demonstrate this. Five years ago, I live with my parents in a rural county. One day, I forgot my home key in the apartment and my parents need to work very late. It is so chill and rainy that I have no idea where to go. However, My situation was added by a compassionate neighbor who invite me to her apartment upon finding me sitting in front of the door and who also providing me with food and a place to stay. This example illustrates the value of having a neighbor who help us in these unplanned situations.</p>
<p>secondly, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him. People view their home as a sanctuary from a stressful modern world. For example, I live alone in an apartment in a big city. My job at that time was extremely stressful. After a day at work, I want nothing more than went home and relax. However, the person living above me played loud music all the night which made me almost impossible to sleep. He has no respect of those living around him and thought only of himself. In contrast, the person who lives above me today doesn’t do this. <strong>When he wants to organize a party, he will ask me whether it will disturb me. Because we respect each other, we can be harmonious.</strong> The example demonstrates how important it is to having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>
