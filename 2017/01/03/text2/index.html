        <h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h1><p>Some students prefer classes with open discussions between the professor and students and almost no lectures. Other students prefer classes with lectures and almost no discussions. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.<br>``课堂上有讨论还是没有<br>理由一：讨论帮助我培养智力能力   没讨论太被动，只有事实跟细节不能帮学生。  有讨论帮助创造了聪明的学生<br>比如我参加了一个政治课改变了我的思考世界的方法。  这些讨论让我思考我的政治从哪来。  我发现我更加开放了。    我相信我不会这样 如果我没有听这个讨论的话。</p>
<p>理由二：帮学生培养团队能力。   事实：很多学生腼腆不会交流   讨论教会如何交流，  他们可以用在以后工作上``</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>Classes <strong>where students engage in discussion</strong> and classes where the professor does most of the talking<code>lecture-&gt;talking do talking</code> each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br><code>各有利弊</code>In my opinion, classes with a lot of discussion are better than those without<code>than those without</code>.I <strong>feel</strong> this way for two reasons, which I will <strong>explore</strong> in the following essay.<br><code>个人观点</code></p>
<p>To begin with, I <strong>feel</strong> that classes where <strong>I have the opportunity to speak</strong><code>转换</code> <em>help to</em> develop my intellectual abilities.</p>
<p>Classes where the teacher does all of the talking are very passive, in my opinion.<code>1.说反面</code>  They mostly just <strong>involve</strong> the memorization of facts and details which do not help students in the long run.<code>1.1为反面解释原因</code></p>
<p>On the other hand, I find that classes which involve a lot of debate and interaction <strong>create</strong> very intelligent students.<code>2.说正面</code>  </p>
<p>For example, I <em>recently</em> took a <em>political science class</em> that changed <em>the way I think</em> about the world. <strong>The cut and thrust of debate in the class</strong> <em>made me consider</em> where my political beliefs came from and if they were actually correct.  I came out of the class as a more flexible person and more open to new ideas than ever before.  I believe that I would not have developed in such a way by just listening to lectures.  This example demonstrates how valuable discussion-based classes can be.</p>
<p>Secondly, classes that involve a lot of discussion can help students develop the skills necessary to work well in groups.  Many freshman students arrive at university very shy and unable to communicate well. Discussions in class teach students how to communicate effectively, and they can use this skill to excel in their future careers.  My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true.  When he started university he was a very introverted person and did not enjoy either communicating or working with others.  However, after four years of participating in debates, discussions and presentations in his classes he became a very confident communicator.  As a result, when he began his career after graduation, he excelled in group work and was seen by his co-workers and supervisors as a natural leader.  He was promoted quickly and advanced through the ranks of his company.  Without participating in discussions with his professors and classmates he would not have developed the skills necessary to succeed in this way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I feel strongly that classes which are centered on discussions between professors and students are preferable to those in which the professor does all of the talking.  This is because such classes help students develop academically and because they teach students the skills that they need to find success in the future.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Class have different organization forms according to the existence of discussions and lectures which has caused a disagreement on public. Although some argue that class with full lectures gives students more information, I am in favor of the view that discussions play an important role in class.</p>
<p>To begin with, discussions in class can motivate the class to become more active. If a class is full of lectures, the class is likely to be boring. So students tend to be distract from what the professor say. Also, with no discussion the professor can not know whether his students have understand his lecture. Conversely, if there are some discussions between the professor and students, the students would be enthusiastic to communicate with the professor. The lecture which the professor address can be adjusted properly according to the students’ feedback. For example, in my math class, my teacher Jason allowed us to discuss the difficult part of his lecture. When he know that we confront some complex concepts, he would give a specific explanation about them right away. Even if we have a little bit misunderstanding, he would correct it in class. So we are willing to interact with him. I progressed much more quickly with the important discussions in class.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the discussion students bring more possible insights and ideas related to the topic professor said which will in turn help students fully understand the main point.</p>
