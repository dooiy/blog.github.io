It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.<br>`sample essay:用纸质资料还是用网络资料<br>理由一：纸质可靠        原因：网络资料可以被任何人编辑  所以：网络资料不准确<br>结果：我进场听到很多人拿到网上错误的信息<br>理由二：书更深入        原因：书更长，有用  所以：学生从这些精心策划的书目获益   </p>
<p>my essay:<br>理由一：网上更新     原因：书从编写到发售需要很长时间    所以书的资料过时了<br>结果：我经常听到很多人引用过时的数据<br>理由二：查阅更方便   原因：书太多了，翻书插资料不方便，即使按学科分类了   互联网的搜索工具十分强大 可以很轻易的查到我们想要的内容      所以使用互联网资源更省时间`<br>Secondly, online articles are superior to books because it is easier to search for certain information. Search engines on the internet are powerful and practical, which saves a lot of time for learners of all age. Books, on the other hand, even with systematic classification, are difficult to search for what we want. Specifically, when we require some details in a field, we have to search some books by pages. As a result, I get my assignments quickly with the benefit of online resources.<br>My own experience demonstrates the advantage of the online articles.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>When students <code>do research for their class assignments</code> they use both printed and online sources and both types have distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, I agree that <code>it is better to use</code> printed materials rather than Internet-based resources.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, printed materials such as books and articles are more reliable than online sources of information. <code>1.比较型</code> This is because websites can be edited by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they are <strong>qualified academics</strong>. <code>2.解释</code> As a result of this, articles in online encyclopedias often contain incorrect and <strong>biased information</strong>.  <code>3.结果</code>I have even heard that some people insert incorrect facts into online databases as a mischievous joke. <code>4.even 进一步解释</code> My own experience demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. <code>5.example</code> Two semesters ago, I was assigned a research paper in a freshman history class.  I cited data that I found on Wikipedia which turned out to be completely incorrect.  The information that I included in my essay was so hopelessly wrong that my professor spotted it immediately, causing me to fail the assignment and receive a fairly low grade in the class at the end of the semester.  If I had taken the time to compare what I had read online to a book or a scholarly article I would not have included it and not have received such a bad score in the class.</p>
<p>My own experience can demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. I was assigned with a research in a history class. I used the statistics on Wikipedia which turns out to be incorrect. As a result, I got an low grade and my teacher easily spot the mistakes I make. I think I would avoid that mistake by comparing the data from printed books with the internet.</p>
<p>In addition, books are superior to online articles because they provide a greater depth of information.  Books are much longer than online articles, which makes them useful to learners of all ages.  Students who use printed resources when doing research also benefit from the meticulously curated bibliographical information which they include.  I have personally experienced some of these benefits during my time as an undergraduate student.  For example, when I wrote a paper last semester in a history class, the very first book that I consulted contained a long description of the both the underlying causes and long-term effects of the historical event I was writing about.  In contrast, most of the online articles that I consulted contained little more than facts and dates.  As a result of basing my research on the book rather than the articles, I was able to write an insightful and nuanced essay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that print resources are more useful than online resources.  This is because printed sources of information are less likely to be biased or error-prone, and because books provide a superior level of detail on most topics.</p>
<h3 id="The-Question-1"><a href="#The-Question-1" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Doing research by referring to books or by searching the internet each has their own advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, using the internet to conducting the research is better than using printed resources. I feel this way in two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, the resources on the internet give students more up-to-date and more fresh information. Usually books in a library are renewed in a long time. They may not involve the recent accomplishment and survey which we need in our assignments. However, the websites of the government and some institute provide us accurate and new statistics. For example, I recently took a science class whose assignment is a research for the development of 3D printers which have a big evolution in last few years. There is few records in books when I search for the information in our library. But after I turn to the internet resources, I find a bunch of valuable information about how a 3D printer works and why it becomes popular nowadays. As a result, I finished the assignment well and get praise from my professor. I think I would not accomplished this by looking into printed materials in the library.<br><code>To begin with, online source of information are more up-to-date than printed materials such as books and articles. This is because a lot of time is required for professional books in order to be printed and published. It also takes a long time for libraries to select and purchase these printed materials. As a result, articles in universities&#39; libraries often contain old and antiquated information.</code></p>
<p>Secondly, when conducting research with our classmates, we can communicate and collaborate with each other though the internet. Doing researching in a group can accelerate the process effectively. However, it is inconvenient for group members to gather together to share the information they got in a room. With a lot of useful tools through the internet, we can communicate wherever and whenever we are. My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true. When he started university, he didn’t buy his own computer in his dorm. He needs to go to the meeting room with his classmates to communicate about their research everyday. After he has a laptop in the second semester, he can talk to his teammate through the internet just at his dorm.They can easily accomplish their assignments with the collaboration. He got a better grade and progressed a lot in the second semester. Without the efficient communication with his classmates through the internet, he would not succeed in this way by only using printed resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that using the internet are preferable to only using the printed resources. This is because the internet can provide more up-to-date and fresh information and because the efficient communication on computer through the internet saves a lot of time.</p>
