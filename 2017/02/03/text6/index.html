        <p>##The Question</p>
<p>Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).<br>旅游需要有人陪嘛？<br>理由一： 有人陪同比没人陪同更经济。 as随着旅游越来越普遍，旅馆开始收更高的住宿费。  单人房间现在已经不常见了，与一个人分享房间是个好办法。 不仅如此人们结伴而行更容易获得团购。</p>
<p>理由二：结伴而行更容易跟当地人交谈。   while当一个人的时候会被看作很恐慌，一对夫妇会被认为更容易让人亲近。</p>
<p>##Sample essay<br>These days, tourism is more popular than ever, and everyone has their own style of travel.  Some people like to take trips alone, while others like to travel with a companion.  Personally, I prefer to travel with a partner.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone.  As leisure travel has become more and more common, hotel operators have started to charge increasingly high costs for accommodation.  Single occupancy rates are fairly uncommon nowadays, so sharing a room with a companion is good way to cut accommodation costs in half.  Not only that, but people traveling in pairs have better access to package deals on tours, entrance fees and other activities.  My own experience demonstrates some of the financial benefits of going on a trip with a friend.  When my girlfriend and I traveled together through Peru last year we were able to rent an entire hotel room for less than the cost of both of us sleeping in a shared dorm.  Over the course of our one month trip, we saved several hundred dollars in this way.  As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plans and extend our trip for almost an entire week.  This example demonstrates some of the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Moreover, in my experience it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in a pair and this makes any trip much more rewarding.  While a lone stranger can be seen as intimidating, a traveling couple (particularly a mixed-gender couple) is often considered more approachable.  For example, when my girlfriend and I took the aforementioned South American trip last year we were often welcomed into people’s homes and businesses with open arms.  The people who invited us often pointed out that they were willing to do so because we looked so happy, friendly and cheerful spending time together.  The welcome that we experienced as a pair was in stark contrast to my earlier experiences as a single travel, when it was much harder form connections with locals.  While a single traveler may be quite kind and cheerful, this can be somewhat difficult to determine from a distance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I definitely prefer to travel with a companion rather than alone.  This is based on the financial benefits of doing so, and because traveling with a partner makes it easy to interact with local people.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Traveling is something I dreamed of since I was a child. When having a trip, people can have a friend with them or be alone. Both types have their own disadvantages and advantages. In my opinion, it is better to travel with a companion. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Tourism is more popular than ever and everyone has their own style of travel. Some people like to take trip alone, while others like to travel with a companion. Personally, I prefer travel with a partner. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone. As travel becomes more and more common, the hotel owner has charged increasingly high cost for accommodation. So sharing a room with our partner can cut accommodation cost in half. Not only that, people traveling with partners have better access to package deals on entrance fee, tours and other activities.<br>For example, last year, I have trip to Beijing with my best friend. Because a standard room in the hotel has two bed, we only need to order one for accommodation. On the way to the landscapes, we saved several hundred dollars in this way since one car is enough for us to get there. As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plan and extend our trip for another week.    This example demonstrates the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking a trip with a partner has more fun than traveling alone. one person who traveling alone may feel boring while traveling in pair make any trip rewarding. When traveling to a new place with a partner, I can be able to communicate and share happiness with each other. However, if I travel alone, I may feel lonely in a totally strange and new place. My example can demonstrate that this is true. In my high school, I travel to Japan on my own. The trip is so long that I feel bored on the plane. I have no idea of how to communicate with local people which made me feel lonely during the trip. In contrast, when my girlfriend and I travel <strong>together</strong> through Japan <strong>last year</strong> again, I feel very happy and excited. As a result of that, I am relaxed and enjoyable. This example demonstrates the importance of a companion for creating fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in pair and this make any trip more rewarding. <code>A lone stranger can be seen as intimidating while a traveling couple is often considered more approachable. 使用while作对比</code> . For example， when my girlfriend and I take a trip to Japan,</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that traveling with a companion is preferable than traveling alone. This is because having a partner on a trip helps to save money and because our trip are more excited.</p>
