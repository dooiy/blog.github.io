        <p>##The Question</p>
<p>Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).</p>
<p>##Sample essay</p>
<p>Traveling is something I dreamed of since I was a child. When having a trip, people can have a friend with them or be alone. Both types have their own disadvantages and advantages. In my opinion, it is better to travel with a companion. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Tourism is more popular than ever and everyone has their own style of travel. Some people like to take trip alone, while others like to travel with a companion. Personally, I prefer travel with a partner. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone. As travel becomes more and more common, the hotel owner has charged increasingly high cost for accommodation. So sharing a room with our partner can cut accommodation cost in half. Not only that, people traveling with partners have better access to package deals on entrance fee, tours and other activities.<br>For example, last year, I have trip to Beijing with my best friend. Because a standard room in the hotel has two bed, we only need to order one for accommodation. On the way to the landscapes, we saved a lot since one car is enough for us to get there. As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plan and extend our trip for another week.    This example demonstrates the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking a trip with a partner has more fun than traveling alone. one person who traveling alone may feel boring while traveling in pair make any trip rewarding. When traveling to a new place with a partner, I can be able to communicate and share happiness with each other. However, if I travel alone, I may feel lonely in a totally strange and new place. My example can demonstrate that this is true. In my high school, I travel to Japan on my own. The trip is so long that I feel bored on the plane. I have no idea of how to communicate with local people which made me feel lonely during the trip. In contrast, when my girlfriend and I travel <strong>together</strong> through Japan <strong>last year</strong> again, I feel very happy and excited. As a result of that, I am relaxed and enjoyable. This example demonstrates the importance of a companion for creating fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in pair and this make any trip more rewarding. <code>A lone stranger can be seen as intimidating while a traveling couple is often considered more approachable. 使用while作对比</code> . For example， when my girlfriend and I take a trip to Japan,</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that traveling with a companion is preferable than traveling alone. This is because having a partner on a trip helps to save money and because our trip are more excited.</p>
