<p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>电视摧毁了朋友与家人之间的交流了么<br>理由一：电视给了我们很多谈资   电视有很多精彩的节目，很多人观看   如果我们都看过，我们可以深入的交流讨论评价电视节目<br><code>\
理由二：电视给了我们与家人朋友在一起的机会   过去 我们各自有各自的娱乐活动， 经常不在一起。   现在，相反，全家人都很爱看电视，这是因为电影很符合很多人的口味   结果在休闲的时候，全家人经常一起看电视，互相聊天，促进了交流。</code></p>
<p>Sample<br>理由一：电视帮助我们有一个有意义的谈话help has。    过去，朋友们大多数谈论共性in common。  经常，人们生活在相当简单的生活，话题很有限the topics are limited because people live in a simple life。     现在相反 每个人可以享受激烈的讨论，他们在电视上看到的广泛的活动，世界大事 everyone can enjoy debate about affaires in the world  </p>
<p>理由二：</p>
<p>These days television plays an important role in our entertainment and almost everyone has their favorite sort of TV programmes. For this reason, there is a lot of debate about whether television has destroyed communication among friends and family. In my opinion, the advent of television has not had a negative effect on the communication. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Television actually provide us sorts of topics that friends can talk about. There are many fairly popular programmes on TV and if fiend and I have watched them, we are able to have a spirited debate and a deep review about them. As a result, many students in my class become intimate friends because they tend to be fond of a certain TV show. In contrast, those people who don’t watch TV have limited topic in common because they live in simple lives.</p>
<p>Television creates more opportunities for families to be together. In the past, my parents and I have our own h</p>
<p>#sample essay</p>
<p>These days there is a lot of debate about how television has destroyed communication between human beings.  However, I strongly believe that the advent of televised entertainment has not had a negative effect on interpersonal communication.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, I contend that television actually <em>helps</em> people to have more <em>meaningful</em> conversations.  In the past, people mostly talked about what they had in common.  <em>Often</em>, talk of this sort was quite limited <strong>because people lived fairly simple lives.</strong>  These days, <strong>in contrast</strong>, individuals can enjoy spirited discussions about <em>the wide array of current events and world affairs</em> <em>that they hear about on television</em> every day.  For example, I have a regular Friday lunch date with my work colleagues at a local restaurant.  We do talk about office affairs, but most of our conversations are about the wide world around us which we learn about from watching television.  We talk about everything from political developments in distant countries to sports results from entirely different continents.  I strongly believe that without television to supply us with topics, my colleagues and I would talk mainly about banal office gossip.我与同事有个约会，我们讨论公司事物，但我们大部分讨论从电视上得知的这个世界，从政治到体育结果 来自完全不同的洲</p>
<p>Secondly, I am of the opinion that television has mostly replaced solitary activities, rather than replacing interactions with others.  <em>It appears that</em> television has mainly replaced hobbies like reading and exercising.  My own experience is compelling evidence of this.  I grew up in a very rural area without access to stable television signals and as a result, I spent most of my free time reading books and magazines.  When I started university, however, I moved to a big city and suddenly had access to one hundred channels.  Almost immediately, watching shows and movies replaced reading as my primary hobby.  I now read almost no books, but as I indicated in the above paragraph I still have meaningful conversations with friends on a regular basis.（我在一个农村长大，没有电视信号。（and as a result）我大部分时间看书和杂志），当我开始了大学生活，我到了一个大城市，然后突然可以收到很多频道。几乎同时，看show跟电影取代了我原来的hobby。我现在不看电视了，但我仍然与我的朋友有交流。</p>
<p>In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that the advent of television has harmed communication between friends and family.  I feel this way because television supplies us with a variety of topics which we can discuss with our friends, and because television-watching has mostly replaced solitary hobbies  rather than social activities. </p>
