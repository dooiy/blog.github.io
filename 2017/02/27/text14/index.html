<p>“Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.”</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>地球被伤害<br>环境污染     人类活动产生了很多污染，破坏了环境natural environment。 This is the result of    工厂生产industrial development，汽车行驶，都产生了有毒的气体。           尽管我们努力限制排放，但是还是不能inevitable避免伤害环境因为生产生活需要。           这些污染将对我们的身体有害，长久之后我们将遭受呼吸疾病，人类活动伤害了地球。    举个例子，过去 我家乡曾今是个美丽的农村 有很多树木与动物。 2而现在造了很多工厂和公路。工厂排放出黑色的烟雾，特别难闻。我几乎不能呼吸，只能迁到其他城市。if without that</p>
<p>human activity has caused most of the pollution that is damaging the natural environment. This is the result of industrialization. Although human are trying to limit the volume of emissions around the world, it will inevitably cause serious environmental problems. These problems not only affect nature but also have a terrible effect on human health and, over a long period of time, we will suffer from a variety of illnesses. My own experience is a good example of this. In the past, I lived in an area of China with beautiful countryside and clean air and rivers. But recently, many factories and roads has been constructed in my hometown. Then black disgusting smoke is emitted from these factories and I had difficulty breathing. Eventually, my family was forced to move to another city because we couldn’t endure the air pollution any longer. without these serious air problems, I would never have had to leave my hometown where I had lived for twenty years.</p>
<p>物种灭绝     很多动物开始灭绝，随着人们的活动。      这是因为动物的栖息地正在被人类的扩张所占据。在这种情况下他们无处可去，数量越来越少。<br>Most of problems are controlled by ourselves, some of them have the hope to be resolved in years.   We are finding the balance between the development and the protection of our Earth.</p>
<p>Human activity is causing the world to change at a rapid pace these days. I am of the opinion that humanity has had a mostly negative effect on the planet.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, <em>industrial development</em> has caused <em>major air pollution,</em> which has a <em>terrible effect</em> on human health.  Every week I hear news reports about how horrible air quality is in major cities all over the world.  Additionally, we often hear that chronic lung diseases are on the rise and that there is connection between these two trends.  I am reminded of the years I spent living in Beijing, China.  After having spent most of my life living in the Canadian countryside where the air is mostly clean, I immediately noticed the smog and pollution of big city China.  Within months I was suffering from a variety of respiratory illnesses and had difficulty breathing.  I spent quite a few afternoons at a local hospital being treated for various throat and lung infections.  A majority of the population of the Earth now resides in cities, and they often suffer from the consequences of industrial development.</p>
<p>Secondly, human development has lead to a massive accumulation of trash, which <em>spoils the natural beauty</em> of the planet.  While in the past products were often made of <em>biodegradable materials</em> like paper and wood, today most <em>manufactured goods</em> are made of plastic that never <em>breaks down</em>.  Such materials sometimes find their way into permanent landfills, but often they just end up as litter.  When I traveled to the island of Borneo last summer I was impressed by the beauty of the place, but I also noticed that the natural environment was marred by an accumulation of plastic bags and water bottles that were strewn everywhere.  Had I visited the island a century ago I would not have found it tainted in such a way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that human activity has made the planet a less pleasant place to live.  This is because people are more likely to suffer from the effects of pollution than in the past, and because human waste has destroyed the natural beauty of our world.</p>
