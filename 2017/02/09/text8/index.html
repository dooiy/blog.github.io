<p>理由一：父母偏见。为什么偏见？觉得自己孩子聪明  怎么偏见了？ 教的太快  结果孩子有严重后果。<br>理由二：父母观点落后。为什么落后？离开学校都20年了？    怎么落后了？不知道互联网教育   结果让孩子跟不上学习。<br>parents are biased when it comes to their own children.

Over a course of and entire school year, this can have serious consequences.<br><code>1.think 用 assume     2.当对象是孩子的时候用 When it comes to      3.a course of an entire school year 学年</code></p>
<p>These days, homeschooling is becoming a more and more popular alternative to traditional learning methods and many parents believe that they can do a better job than professional educators.  I, however, do not agree with the idea that parents are the best teachers.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>is becoming popular alternative to    and   parents believe</code></p>
<p>First of all, parents are biased when it comes to their own children.  To be specific, most parents think that their children are the smartest in the world.<code>简单句</code>  As a result, they often teach their children <strong>at an inappropriately quick pace</strong> and <strong>mistakenly</strong> <strong>assume</strong> that they will be able to <strong>keep up</strong>.<code>复合句and 第二句副词提前</code>  Over the course of <strong>an entire school year</strong> this can have serious consequences.  An old friend of mine is a good example of this.  <strong>Rather than attending the local public school,</strong> my friend was taught at home by his mother.<code>介绍基本情况</code>  His mother had good intentions, but she failed completely at teaching him math.  She made the assumption that her son was able to grasp the basic concepts right away and moved on immediately to advanced concepts that were a full two grade-levels above what he would have been learning at the public school.  <strong>When it came time for my friend to take the annual state-mandated competency tests</strong> he was wholly unprepared and he <strong>shocked his mom</strong> with a failing grade.  This example demonstrates that, indeed, parents are not always the best teachers.<br>首先，当对自己的孩子时，父母会有偏见。很多父母认为他们的孩子是最聪明的。认为他们跟得上。这有严重的后果。我一个老同学是个很好的例子。 <em>1.基本情况</em>：他不是在当地学校学习，而是在家跟妈妈学。<em>2.简介结果：</em> 他妈妈心是好的，但是她数学教学彻底失败了。<em>3.原因：</em> 她估计他的孩子可以很快的抓住基本概念，然后迅速转向高级的概念。而这些概念在当地学校需要高两级的同学才能理解。  <em>4.结果：</em> 当她参加每年的州里的比赛时，她获得了低分。这个例子告诉我们父母不总是最好的老师</p>
<p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern teaching methods and <strong>therefore</strong> use antiquated and ineffective methods to educate their children.  <strong>Parents have children at increasingly advanced ages nowadays and when it comes time to teach their children, they have been out of school for ten or twenty years.</strong> Professional teachers, <strong>in contrast,</strong> have time for professional development every year of their careers and work in a collaborative environment where experienced teachers are kept up to date by their younger colleagues.  This means that trained teachers excel at teaching children of all backgrounds, while parents struggle to teach their own children.  While my friend’s mother eventually overcame her difficulty teaching math to her son, the next year she had a lot of trouble motivating him to keep up with his language lessons.  She was proactive, though, and sought help from her local school board.  The officials at the board put her in touch with a young teacher from a nearby elementary school.  That teacher showed her how to use the Internet to help her son find foreign-language resources more suited to his specific interests.  Until she got help from that young teacher, she had no idea that the Internet included a wealth of videos, music and games that she could utilize in her home classroom.<br>数学 math<br>我朋友的妈妈，第二年跟不上了</p>
<p>我朋友的妈妈克服苦难教孩子数学，但是第二年她就觉得跟上孩子的课程有难度了／力不从心／跟不上。她很积极，去学校寻求帮助。学校让他与一个任课老师沟通。老师给她演示了现在怎么使用internet去学习外语。  直到她从那个老师获得帮助，她才知道互联网很多视频 游戏 可以用来帮助她的家庭教育。</p>
<p>while my friend’s mother <em>eventually</em> overcame the difficulty teach <em>ing</em> her <em>son</em> math, the next year she had <em>a lot of</em> trouble <em>motivating her son</em> to keep up <em>with</em> the language lesson. She is proactive and sought help from the <em>local</em> school <em>broad</em>. The officials at school let her to communicate with a young teacher <em>from the nearby elementary school</em>. The teacher showed her how to use the internet to <em>find foreign-language resources more suited to his specific interests</em>. until she got help from that <em>young</em> teacher, she has no idea that the internet has a <em>wealth</em> of video <em>s</em> pictures and games <em>that she can utilize in her classroom</em><code>不断具体</code></p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea that parents are the best educators in their children’s lives.  This is because parents see their children with biased eyes and because professional teachers benefit from modern techniques and training.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>341 words<br>Our parents are the ones who teach us walk and run after we was born. Literally, they are our earliest teachers, but it is controversy to decide whether can do better than many normal teachers. In my opinion, parents are the best teachers. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, parents are more familiar with us than any teacher and easily they with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to give us more appropriate advice. Our teachers, who need to teach many children in class, have no time to find out the best way for each individuals to impart their knowledge. My own experience can demonstrate the importance of method of education. When I was in my high school, I spend a lot of time on my mathematics which I got lowest grade on. My teacher gave me a ton of suggestions, while none of them turned out to be useful. When I ask my dad for help, he immediately pointed out that I misunderstand some important meaning of the question. I progressed much more quickly with the help of my dad than I did while following my teacher’s advice.</p>
<p>Secondly, parents have much more time accompany with their children, and teachers are replaced once a year. It is difficult to develop a good habit because it needs a constant and long time. Our parents have enough opportunity and time urge us to form a good habit. For example, my cousin’s teacher told him to read English every morning and write a diary everyday. His parents help him stay focused and avoid distraction when studying everyday. After one year, he was accustomed to these habit and got things done spontaneously due to the effort of his parents. This demonstrates that their parents are the best teacher in their lives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that parents are the best teacher of their children. This is because they know their children well and because they have abundant time accompany their children.</p>
<h1 id="Imitation"><a href="#Imitation" class="headerlink" title="Imitation"></a>Imitation</h1><p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern educational methods and therefore use antiquated and ineffective methods to teach their children. <code>原因and therefore结果  避免了 直接parents are likely， because</code></p>
<p>parents have children at an increasingly age and when it came time to teach there children, they have been out of school for ten or even twenty years. Teachers, however, have time for professional development every year of their career and work in a collaborative environment where teachers keep up to date.</p>
