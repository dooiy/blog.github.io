<p>万能理由：能力<br>allow<br>As a result, I <strong>performed more poorly on the test</strong> than I would have if I had just studied alone.<br>解释and this means that<br><strong>suffer from the fact</strong> that<br>I am a very social creature and this means that when…… I<br>Thankfully I have avoided this problem since then as I have decided to always study by myself.</p>
<p>#The Question:</p>
<p>Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of fellow students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer</p>
<p>#My Essay<br>独自学习还是与同学一起<br>独自学习好<br>理由一：安静不分心          独立学习给予了我们一个安静的环境，允许我们集中注意力。   与朋友一起学习，我们很难不讨论学习之外的东西（无意义的联系，make jokes）and as a result 我们分心了，效率也变低了。相反， 独自学习可以让我们集中注意力解决问题。这是因为我们可以想的更加全面。</p>
<p>理由二：独立解决问题，更能提升自己实力       独立学习可以帮助我们提高自己解决问题的能力。  很多同学在遇到困难的时候，很害怕而且很无助。这是因为他们经常从别人哪里获得帮助，从而丧失了自己思考的能力。 相反，在独自学习的时候，我们只能自己想办法解决难题，这强迫我们提高了自己的能力。在未来的职业生涯中，我们精通于处理问题，这让我们升职地很快。</p>
<p>everyone has their own prefered study methods, and all of them have their benefits. There is a constant debate about whether students should study on their own or study with their friends. In my opinion, Studying alone is better than studying in a group. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, studying alone provides us a quiet place, which allow us to concentrate on our assignments. This is because we are easily distract in group studying, regardless of whether we make firm plans. As a result, I heard about that many students studying in a group find out wasting time sitting together for their coming exams. On the other hand, when studying on their own, they focus on specific area of the subject that I am struggling with and thought carefully about it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, studying by ourselves can help us develop the ability to solve difficult problems on their own. Many youngsters become depression and helpless when confronting problems and this is because they are accustomed to ask for help from others. Studying alone force students to solve difficulties without other’s help and they can use this skill in their future careers.</p>
<p>#Sample Essay<br>Everyone has their own preferred study methods, and all of them have their benefits.  I am of the opinion that it is better to study alone than to study as part of a group.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, studying alone <em>allows me to focus on</em> specific areas of a subject <em>that I am struggling with</em>, rather than doing a broad overview of the class.  I always attend my classes and communicate <em>regularly</em> with my professors and teachers, <em>so</em> I am <em>constantly aware of</em> which topics I need to focus on when I study.  <em>When I study in a group,</em> everyone in the group has different needs, and the study session is required to touch on all of them.  As a freshman four years ago, I was not aware of this and <em>found myself</em> wasting my time studying in a group for an important European history exam.  I knew that I really needed to focus on religious history, <em>but sat uncomfortably through a group study session that</em> <strong>progressed through political, cultural, scientific, literary and artistic history</strong> before touching only briefly on the issue of religion.  As a result, I <strong>performed more poorly on the test</strong> than <strong>I would have if I had just studied alone</strong>.大一的时候，我不知道这个，然后发现我在浪费时间在团队准备历史考试。 我知道我应该集中于宗教历史，但是</p>
<p>Furthermore, I recognize that I am a very <em>social creature</em>, and this means that <em>when I study in a group</em> I am easily distracted.  I am not the only person who has this problem; many people will agree that they too desire to socialize rather than study when in a group of friends and classmates.  My example of studying for that European history class is a good example of this.  Not only did I <strong>suffer from the fact</strong> that the we only <strong>touched</strong> briefly on my problem area, but certain group members (including myself) were easily <strong>drawn off-topic</strong>.  We were quick to make jokes about the material <strong>being covered</strong>, or <strong>make tenuous and meaningless connections</strong> between those topics and our own lives.  Thankfully I have avoided this problem since then as I have decided to always study by myself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that studying alone is better than studying in a group.  This is because studying alone allows me to focus on the areas that I need to, and because it helps me to avoid  socializing when I should be studying.</p>
