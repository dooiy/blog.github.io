<h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h1><p>Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>题目：立刻花钱还是存钱 可以两个事物比较<br>理由一：有经验的人买东西理性。（年轻人花在没用的东西上）  买长期快乐的东西   小时候买东西 长大了没得花<br>people with a lot of maturity and experience make better financial decisions than youngsters. <em>可以直接说理由1，没总结</em><br><em>一套对比论证</em> young people, who have little life experience, are prone to spend their money on products and consumer goods that are mostly useless.<br>Older people, on the other hand, knows what will result in long-term happiness and satisfaction.<br><code>1.a lot of maturity成熟     life experience生活经验  make financial decision经济决策    youngsters年轻人young people
东西products and consumer goods   大多数的mostly     
2.做对比 in contrast 或者 on the other hand</code></p>
<p>理由二：生活中有紧急情况。  医疗破产，   没钱很丢人<br>叔叔生病，因为花钱导致要借钱，很丢人<br>Money concerns are a major cause of stress in the modern world as people struggle to decide if they should spend their money to satisfy immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns.  In my opinion, it is a much better idea to save money for the future.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better financial than youngsters.<br>Young people, who have very little life experience, are prone to spending their money on products and consumer goods that are mostly useless and which they soon tire of.  Older people, on the other hand, know which purchases will result in long-term happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.</p>
<p><code>When I was young, I spent a tremendous amount of money on video games and comic books.</code></p>
<p><code>When I **later** **enrolled in university**, I did not have much money left to pay for my tuition, and was forced to take out a significant number of student loans.</code></p>
<p>Moreover, life is full of unexpected emergencies which often take a significant financial toll on people.  I recently read a newspaper article which pointed out that seventy-five percent of all bankruptcies in the United States are the result of medical expenses. I am well aware that it is humiliating to lose our financial independence.  </p>
<p>For example, last year</p>
<p><code>my uncle suffered a major heart attack which required him to undergo very expensive bypass surgery.</code></p>
<p><strong>He avoided bankruptcy, <em>but</em> did have to ask his elderly parents for a loan to pay his bills.</strong></p>
<p><code>They, unlike him, resisted the urge to spend and saved money through their entire lives.</code></p>
<p><code>He felt extremely embarrassed about begging his parents for assistance, especially as he could have avoided the situation by emulating their frugal behavior.</code></p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost everyone enjoys buying what they want. Some like to spend money right after they earn it, while others prefer saving money for another time in the future. In my opinion, I think it is better to save money in the bank and plan for future. I feel this way <em>for</em> two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>people struggle to decide if they should spend money satisfying one&#39;s immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns</code></p>
<p>To begin with, having some money in the bank helps us deal with some of unplanned emergencies. As our lives are full with unpredictable emergencies, this money provides an important assistance during the time. If we spend all the money recklessly, we will suffer a lot in the future. My cousin’s experience demonstrates that this is true. Five years ago, he had a job in a busy city. When getting his salary in the first week of each month, he would spend all of it on what he want. Unfortunately, his mother got a very serious illness<code>suffered a illness</code> two years ago, which needed a large amount of money in order to operate<code>undergo an expensive surgery</code> a surgery. <code>He did not have much money left to pay for the surgery, and had to take much time to borrow a lot from his friends due to his unwise financial plan.</code> Without prompt treatment, the illness of his mother got more serious. These days he is much more <em>conservative</em> in his spending, and <strong>carefully</strong> consider all of his <em>expenses</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large amount of money we saved for a long time helps us do expensive things such as traveling and studying abroad. As tourism is more popular than ever, the hotel owner has charged increasingly for accommodation. It is so expensive that we need to save money for a long time. For example, when my sister and I planned to study abroad in America, we were surprised by the cost we need. Both of us worked and saved money in order to afford the tuition fee and rent. If I spend money without limit, I would not make it and have the courage to go foreign country. This demonstrates some of the benefits of saving money.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is preferable to saving money for sometime in the future. This is because this money help us to deal with some unplanned emergencies and because we can afford some expensive plan with this money.</p>
