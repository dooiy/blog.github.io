How does this increase in the availability of information influence life in today’s world?”</p>
<p>信息易得，怎么影响生活<br>观点一：学习更轻松  互联网上有很多资源，对学习有很大帮助     这些资源新，让人感兴趣。  可以很容易的掌握知识      </p>

<h1 id="My-Essay"><a href="#My-Essay" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Everyone can dramatically easily surfing the Internet to get the information they want nowadays. In my opinion, this easy access to information has a deep influence in researching and entertainment.</p>
<p>To begin with, the availability of up-to-date professional information helps us to do research well. The information offered by some institute include some findings, professional survey, and achievements in particular field which gives us some background knowledge.  Without this information, we are likely to spend a lot of time on redundant work.<br><code>科研论文语聊积累</code><br>For example, when I was attempting to write an essay about a topic, I was easily get lost if I have little background knowledge. After getting information from the Internet, I can have a thorough understand of the topic. Additionally, a new</p>
<p>Secondly, we are able to listen to even all the music and watch large amount of movies through the Internet which means we can have recreation at home. In the past, there are only few films in the cinema. We need go out with our friends to watch a movie. These days, however, we can easily access to new films on the Internet at home. My own experience is a good example of this. When I want some music to relax, I just need to open the apple music APP, then plenty of music will play constantly. When I heard about a new movie, what I have to do is to sign in a movie website and enjoy it. I save a lot of time and money with the availability of the valuable information on the Internet.</p>
<h1 id="Sample-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways.  In my opinion, the most prominent effect of the Internet is that it has strengthened democracy.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, online investigative reporting <em>plays a major role in</em> exposing political corruption and keeping politicians honest.  <em>In the past,</em> there were only <em>a limited number of</em> news outlets and they often had deep connections to powerful politicians and were hesitant to criticize them. <em>These days, however,</em> there are many independent publications on the Internet that are willing to expose political misbehavior.  For example, an online magazine recently published a story revealing that the mayor of my hometown had taken bribes from a property developer.  The report was so detailed and well-researched that the mayor had no choice but to resign.  Although the evidence was not hard to locate, only this independent website was willing to write about it.  This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to strengthen democracy in the modern world.</p>
<p>Secondly, the free exchange of ideas found online <em>motivates</em> people to become politically active.  In countries all over the world, people use social networking sites to share their ideas and opinions.  <em>While in the past</em> people might have thought that they were alone in their beliefs, <em>they can now</em> realize that others share their ideas. My own experience demonstrates this concept.  <em>When I was a university student</em>, I learned that a municipal park near my residence <em>was going to be</em> demolished to make room for a parking lot.  <em>This bothered me</em> a lot because I enjoyed spending time in the park.  At first I thought that there was nothing that I, as an individual, could do to stop this from happening.  However, I later joined a Facebook group dedicated to opposing the plan.  When the members of the group learned how many people in the city loved the park we were happy to get together and enthusiastically protest in front of city hall until our voices were heard.  I think that finding each other on that Facebook group gave us the courage to actively protect our park.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has strengthened democracy in modern society.  This is because online investigative journalism <em>plays a big part</em> in keeping politicians honest, and because social networking sites encourage people to be politically active.</p>
<h1 id="revise"><a href="#revise" class="headerlink" title="revise"></a>revise</h1><p>Most people agree that the Internet affects society in many different ways. In my opinion, the effect of the Internet is that it has changed the way we entertain and research.</p>
<p>To begin with, online movies plays a major role in recreation nowadays. In the past, there were  a limited films and they can only be accessed in a cinema. These days, however, majority of websites offers movies without charge. We are available to old and classic films which are hard to find in a cinema. For example， when I want to watch a classic movie named The Godfather, I have no choice but download from the Internet because it won’t played by a cinema. When I invite my friends to my house, we can watch as much movie as we want at home instead of going to a cinema. This example demonstrates how the Internet helps to change the way we enjoy movies.</p>
<p>Secondly, the internet is the major source for scholarly journals, current news and books which help us conduct research. Many reliable statistics, articles and other information can be found on government or educational websites, while in the past conducting research involved a trip to the library. My own experience demonstrates this concept. When I was a university freshmen, I was assigned to do a research related to an animal. At first, I went to the library and bookstores for valuable information. However, I later found that is time-consuming and I switch to get information from the Internet. A number of websites such as Goole and Yahoo offers information about any topic I desire. As a result, I accomplished the research quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Internet has change our life dramatically in entertainment and research. This is because the Internet offers plenty of movies and because some educational websites contain a lot of useful information for research.</p>

<h2 id="tags"><a href="#tags" class="headerlink" title="tags:"></a>tags:</h2><h1 id="The-Question"><a href="#The-Question" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h1><p>Some students prefer classes with open discussions between the professor and students and almost no lectures. Other students prefer classes with lectures and almost no discussions. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.<br>``课堂上有讨论还是没有<br>理由一：讨论帮助我培养智力能力   没讨论太被动，只有事实跟细节不能帮学生。  有讨论帮助创造了聪明的学生<br>比如我参加了一个政治课改变了我的思考世界的方法。  这些讨论让我思考我的政治从哪来。  我发现我更加开放了。    我相信我不会这样 如果我没有听这个讨论的话。</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay-1"><a href="#Sample-Essay-1" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>Classes <strong>where students engage in discussion</strong> and classes where the professor does most of the talking<code>lecture-&gt;talking do talking</code> each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br><code>各有利弊</code>In my opinion, classes with a lot of discussion are better than those without<code>than those without</code>.I <strong>feel</strong> this way for two reasons, which I will <strong>explore</strong> in the following essay.<br><code>个人观点</code></p>
<p>To begin with, I <strong>feel</strong> that classes where <strong>I have the opportunity to speak</strong><code>转换</code> <em>help to</em> develop my intellectual abilities.</p>
<p>Classes where the teacher does all of the talking are very passive, in my opinion.<code>1.说反面</code>  They mostly just <strong>involve</strong> the memorization of facts and details which do not help students in the long run.<code>1.1为反面解释原因</code></p>
<p>On the other hand, I find that classes which involve a lot of debate and interaction <strong>create</strong> very intelligent students.<code>2.说正面</code>  </p>
<p>For example, I <em>recently</em> took a <em>political science class</em> that changed <em>the way I think</em> about the world. <strong>The cut and thrust of debate in the class</strong> <em>made me consider</em> where my political beliefs came from and if they were actually correct.  I came out of the class as a more flexible person and more open to new ideas than ever before.  I believe that I would not have developed in such a way by just listening to lectures.  This example demonstrates how valuable discussion-based classes can be.</p>
<p>Secondly, classes that involve a lot of discussion can help students develop the skills necessary to work well in groups.  Many freshman students arrive at university very shy and unable to communicate well. Discussions in class teach students how to communicate effectively, and they can use this skill to excel in their future careers.  My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true.  When he started university he was a very introverted person and did not enjoy either communicating or working with others.  However, after four years of participating in debates, discussions and presentations in his classes he became a very confident communicator.  As a result, when he beg</p>
<p>an his career after graduation, he excelled in group work and was seen by his co-workers and supervisors as a natural leader.  He was promoted quickly and advanced through the ranks of his company.  Without participating in discussions with his professors and classmates he would not have developed the skills necessary to succeed in this way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I feel strongly that classes which are centered on discussions between professors and students are preferable to those in which the professor does all of the talking.  This is because such classes help students develop academically and because they teach students the skills that they need to find success in the future.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay-1"><a href="#My-Essay-1" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Class have different organization forms according to the existence of discussions and lectures which has caused a disagreement on public. Although some argue that class with full lectures gives students more information, I am in favor of the view that discussions play an important role in class.</p>
<p>To begin with, discussions in class can motivate the class to become more active. If a class is full of lectures, the class is likely to be boring. So students tend to be distract from what the professor say. Also, with no discussion the professor can not know whether his students have understand his lecture. Conversely, if there are some discussions between the professor and students, the students would be enthusiastic to communicate with the professor. The lecture which the professor address can be adjusted properly according to the students’ feedback. For example, in my math class, my teacher Jason allowed us to discuss the difficult part of his lecture. When he know that we confront some complex concepts, he would give a specific explanation about them right away. Even if we have a little bit misunderstanding, he would correct it in class. So we are willing to interact with him. I progressed much more quickly with the important discussions in class.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the discussion students bring more possible insights and ideas related to the topic professor said which will in turn help students fully understand the main point.</p>

It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet.

Search engines on the internet are powerful and practical, which saves a lot of time for learners of all age. Books, on the other hand, even with systematic classification, are difficult to search for what we want. Specifically, when we require some details in a field, we have to search some books by pages. As a result, I get my assignments quickly with the benefit of online resources.<br>My own experience demonstrates the advantage of the online articles.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay-2"><a href="#Sample-Essay-2" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>When students <code>do research for their class assignments</code> they use both printed and online sources and both types have distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, I agree that <code>it is better to use</code> printed materials rather than Internet-based resources.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, printed materials such as books and articles are more reliable than online sources of information. <code>1.比较型</code> This is because websites can be edited by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they are <strong>qualified academics</strong>. <code>2.解释</code> As a result of this, articles in online encyclopedias often contain incorrect and <strong>biased information</strong>.  <code>3.结果</code>I have even heard that some people insert incorrect facts into online databases as a mischievous joke. <code>4.even 进一步解释</code> My own experience demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. <code>5.example</code> Two semesters ago, I was assigned a research paper in a freshman history class.  I cited data that I found on Wikipedia which turned out to be completely incorrect.  The information that I included in my essay was so hopelessly wrong that my professor spotted it immediately, causing me to fail the assignment and receive a fairly low grade in the class at the end of the semester.  If I had taken the time to compare what I had read online to a book or a scholarly article I would not have included it and not have received such a bad score in the class.</p>
<p>My own experience can demonstrates the danger of relying too heavily on online sources of information. I was assigned with a research in a history class. I used the statistics on Wikipedia which turns out to be incorrect. As a result, I got an low grade and my teacher easily spot the mistakes I make. I think I would avoid that mistake by comparing the data from printed books with the internet.</p>
<p>In addition, books are superior to online articles because they provide a greater depth of information.  Books are much longer than online articles, which makes them useful to learners of all ages.  Students who use printed resources when doing research also benefit from the meticulously curated bibliographical information which they include.  I have personally experienced some of these benefits during my time as an undergraduate student.  For example, when I wrote a paper last semester in a history class, the very first book that I consulted contained a long description of the both the underlying causes and long-term effects of the historical event I was writing about.  In contrast, most of the online articles that I consulted contained little more than facts and dates.  As a result of basing my research on the book rather than the articles, I was able to write an insightful and nuanced essay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that print resources are more useful than online resources.  This is because printed sources of information are less likely to be biased or error-prone, and because books provide a superior level of detail on most topics.</p>
<h3 id="The-Question-2"><a href="#The-Question-2" class="headerlink" title="The Question"></a>The Question</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to use printed material such as books and articles to do research than it is to use the internet. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<h1 id="My-Essay-2"><a href="#My-Essay-2" class="headerlink" title="My Essay"></a>My Essay</h1><p>Doing research by referring to books or by searching the internet each has their own advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, using the internet to conducting the research is better than using printed resources. I feel this way in two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, the resources on the internet give students more up-to-date and more fresh information. Usually books in a library are renewed in a long time. They may not involve the recent accomplishment and survey which we need in our assignments. However, the websites of the government and some institute provide us accurate and new statistics. For example, I recently took a science class whose assignment is a research for the development of 3D printers which have a big evolution in last few years. There is few records in books when I search for the information in our library. But after I turn to the internet resources, I find a bunch of valuable information about how a 3D printer works and why it becomes popular nowadays. As a result, I finished the assignment well and get praise from my professor. I think I would not accomplished this by looking into printed materials in the library.<br><code>To begin with, online source of information are more up-to-date than printed materials such as books and articles. This is because a lot of time is required for professional books in order to be printed and published. It also takes a long time for libraries to select and purchase these printed materials. As a result, articles in universities&#39; libraries often contain old and antiquated information.</code></p>
<p>Secondly, when conducting research with our classmates, we can communicate and collaborate with each other though the internet. Doing researching in a group can accelerate the process effectively. However, it is inconvenient for group members to gather together to share the information they got in a room. With a lot of useful tools through the internet, we can communicate wherever and whenever we are. My older brother’s experience demonstrates that this is true. When he started university, he didn’t buy his own computer in his dorm. He needs to go to the meeting room with his classmates to communicate about their research everyday. After he has a laptop in the second semester, he can talk to his teammate through the internet just at his dorm.They can easily accomplish their assignments with the collaboration. He got a better grade and progressed a lot in the second semester. Without the efficient communication with his classmates through the internet, he would not succeed in this way by only using printed resources.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that using the internet are preferable to only using the printed resources. This is because the internet can provide more up-to-date and fresh information and because the efficient communication on computer through the internet saves a lot of time.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Independent-Essay"><a href="#Sample-Independent-Essay" class="headerlink" title="Sample Independent Essay"></a>Sample Independent Essay</h1><p>Neighbours play an important role in our lives, and almost everyone in the world has at least one neighbor.  For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor.  In my opinion, a good neighbor is both supportive and respectful.  I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full of unplanned emergencies.  Oftentimes the people live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong.  For example, my family experienced a major house fire several years ago.  It was a traumatic experience as it happened in the middle of the night and we lost most of our belongings.  Though none of us suffered any injuries, we did experience a lot of emotional trauma.  Our situation was aided, however, by a compassionate neighbor who immediately called the fire department upon noticing the fire and who also provided us with clean clothes, food and a place to stay for the night.  This example demonstrates how important it is to have kind and supportive neighbors when an emergency happens.</p>
<p>Moreover, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him.  People view their home as a sort of sanctuary from the stressful modern world and if their neighbors do not respect this belief they will suffer a lot.  My own experience demonstrates this reality.   Five years ago, I lived alone in an apartment in a busy city.  My job at that time was extremely stressful and also physically draining.  After a day at work I wanted nothing more than to go home and unwind. However, the person living in the apartment above me played loud music all night which made it almost impossible for me to relax.  He had no respect for those around him and thought only of himself.  In contrast, the person who lives above my family today does not do this and though I have the same job, I am better able to deal with its difficulties.  This illustrates the value of having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that good neighbors are both supportive and respectful.  This is because such people can help us handle life’s unexpected emergencies and allow us to feel comfortable in our own homes.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay"><a href="#My-essay" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost Everyone in the world has at least a neighbor and neighbor plays an important role in our lives. For this reason, it is important to consider what characteristics define a good neighbor. In my opinion, a good neighbor <strong>is both</strong> supportive and respective. I will explore the reasons why I feel this way in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, a good neighbor must be supportive because our lives are full with unplanned emergencies. If our neighbor do not support us in these situations, we will not make it easily.<code>Oftentimes people who live close to us are the only ones who can provide assistance when things go wrong</code> My own experience demonstrate this reality. Five years ago, I live with my parents in a rural county. One day, I forgot my home key in the apartment and my parents need to work very late. It is so chill and rainy that I have no idea where to go. However, My situation was added by a compassionate neighbor who invite me to her apartment upon finding me sitting in front of the door and who also providing me with food and a place to stay. This example illustrates the value of having a neighbor who help us in these unplanned situations.</p>
<p>secondly, a good neighbor is someone who is respectful of those around him. People view their home as a sanctuary from a stressful modern world. For example, I live alone in an apartment in a big city. My job at that time was extremely stressful. After a day at work, I want nothing more than went home and relax. However, the person living above me played loud music all the night which made me almost impossible to sleep. He has no respect of those living around him and thought only of himself. In contrast, the person who lives above me today doesn’t do this. <strong>When he wants to organize a party, he will ask me whether it will disturb me. Because we respect each other, we can be harmonious.</strong> The example demonstrates how important it is to having a neighbor who respects those who live nearby.</p>

Which country would you like to visit? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).</p>
<p>#Sample Essay</p>
<p>Traveling the world is something I have dreamed about doing ever since I was a small child.  If I was given the choice of visiting a country of my choosing, I would definitely go to Peru.  There are two main reasons why I feel this way, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, Peru is a land of varied landscapes and I believe that getting in touch with nature is the best way to enjoy a vacation.  Peru is unique in that it contains a tropical rainforest, some of the highest mountains in the world and even pristine beaches – all within close proximity to each other.  Few countries offer easier access to such a plethora of natural wonders.  One similar country is the United States; I remember that when I traveled across that country several years I was struck by how many different natural environments I was able to experience.  I felt that seeing such scenes helped me really get to know America.  I think that I could have a similar experience in Peru and because that country is much smaller I would have an easier and more affordable vacation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Peru is attractive because it has an extremely varied national cuisine.  I have heard that Peruvian food has been influenced by quite a few sources, including Spanish settlers, local indigenous groups and recent immigrants from the rest of the continent.  Not only that, but visitors to Peru can choose from several different dining venues, ranging from chic modern restaurants to charming street vendors.  I feel that eating the food of a place is another great way to really get to know a society.  I recall that when I visited Japan during my last summer vacation I felt at one with the Japanese people when I visited a local sushi restaurant.  I am certain that I would enjoy a similar feeling dining in Peru which would make a visit to that country very worthwhile.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if I could visit any country in the world, I would choose to travel to Peru.  I feel this way because of Peru’s amazing natural environment and its tantalizingly varied national cuisine.</p>

<p>Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice (from the Official TOEFL Guide).<br>旅游需要有人陪嘛？<br>理由一： 有人陪同比没人陪同更经济。 as随着旅游越来越普遍，旅馆开始收更高的住宿费。  单人房间现在已经不常见了，与一个人分享房间是个好办法。 不仅如此人们结伴而行更容易获得团购。</p>
<p>理由二：结伴而行更容易跟当地人交谈。   while当一个人的时候会被看作很恐慌，一对夫妇会被认为更容易让人亲近。</p>
<p>##Sample essay<br>These days, tourism is more popular than ever, and everyone has their own style of travel.  Some people like to take trips alone, while others like to travel with a companion.  Personally, I prefer to travel with a partner.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone.  As leisure travel has become more and more common, hotel operators have started to charge increasingly high costs for accommodation.  Single occupancy rates are fairly uncommon nowadays, so sharing a room with a companion is good way to cut accommodation costs in half.  Not only that, but people traveling in pairs have better access to package deals on tours, entrance fees and other activities.  My own experience demonstrates some of the financial benefits of going on a trip with a friend.  When my girlfriend and I traveled together through Peru last year we were able to rent an entire hotel room for less than the cost of both of us sleeping in a shared dorm.  Over the course of our one month trip, we saved several hundred dollars in this way.  As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plans and extend our trip for almost an entire week.  This example demonstrates some of the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Moreover, in my experience it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in a pair and this makes any trip much more rewarding.  While a lone stranger can be seen as intimidating, a traveling couple (particularly a mixed-gender couple) is often considered more approachable.  For example, when my girlfriend and I took the aforementioned South American trip last year we were often welcomed into people’s homes and businesses with open arms.  The people who invited us often pointed out that they were willing to do so because we looked so happy, friendly and cheerful spending time together.  The welcome that we experienced as a pair was in stark contrast to my earlier experiences as a single travel, when it was much harder form connections with locals.  While a single traveler may be quite kind and cheerful, this can be somewhat difficult to determine from a distance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I definitely prefer to travel with a companion rather than alone.  This is based on the financial benefits of doing so, and because traveling with a partner makes it easy to interact with local people.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay-1"><a href="#My-essay-1" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Traveling is something I dreamed of since I was a child. When having a trip, people can have a friend with them or be alone. Both types have their own disadvantages and advantages. In my opinion, it is better to travel with a companion. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Tourism is more popular than ever and everyone has their own style of travel. Some people like to take trip alone, while others like to travel with a companion. Personally, I prefer travel with a partner. I feel this way for two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, traveling with a companion is more economical than traveling alone. As travel becomes more and more common, the hotel owner has charged increasingly high cost for accommodation. So sharing a room with our partner can cut accommodation cost in half. Not only that, people traveling with partners have better access to package deals on entrance fee, tours and other activities.<br>For example, last year, I have trip to Beijing with my best friend. Because a standard room in the hotel has two bed, we only need to order one for accommodation. On the way to the landscapes, we saved several hundred dollars in this way since one car is enough for us to get there. As a result of saving so much money, we were able to change our plan and extend our trip for another week.    This example demonstrates the financial benefits of traveling with a companion.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking a trip with a partner has more fun than traveling alone. one person who traveling alone may feel boring while traveling in pair make any trip rewarding. When traveling to a new place with a partner, I can be able to communicate and share happiness with each other. However, if I travel alone, I may feel lonely in a totally strange and new place. My example can demonstrate that this is true. In my high school, I travel to Japan on my own. The trip is so long that I feel bored on the plane. I have no idea of how to communicate with local people which made me feel lonely during the trip. In contrast, when my girlfriend and I travel <strong>together</strong> through Japan <strong>last year</strong> again, I feel very happy and excited. As a result of that, I am relaxed and enjoyable. This example demonstrates the importance of a companion for creating fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is much easier to talk to local people when traveling in pair and this make any trip more rewarding. <code>A lone stranger can be seen as intimidating while a traveling couple is often considered more approachable. 使用while作对比</code> . For example， when my girlfriend and I take a trip to Japan,</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that traveling with a companion is preferable than traveling alone. This is because having a partner on a trip helps to save money and because our trip are more excited.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay-3"><a href="#Sample-Essay-3" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>题目：立刻花钱还是存钱 可以两个事物比较<br>理由一：有经验的人买东西理性。（年轻人花在没用的东西上）  买长期快乐的东西   小时候买东西 长大了没得花<br>people with a lot of maturity and experience make better financial decisions than youngsters. <em>可以直接说理由1，没总结</em><br><em>一套对比论证</em> young people, who have little life experience, are prone to spend their money on products and consumer goods that are mostly useless.<br>Older people, on the other hand, knows what will result in long-term happiness and satisfaction.<br><code>1.a lot of maturity成熟     life experience生活经验  make financial decision经济决策    youngsters年轻人young people
东西products and consumer goods   大多数的mostly     
2.做对比 in contrast 或者 on the other hand</code></p>
<p>理由二：生活中有紧急情况。  医疗破产，   没钱很丢人<br>叔叔生病，因为花钱导致要借钱，很丢人<br>Money concerns are a major cause of stress in the modern world as people struggle to decide if they should spend their money to satisfy immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns.  In my opinion, it is a much better idea to save money for the future.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>people with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to make better financial than youngsters.<br>Young people, who have very little life experience, are prone to spending their money on products and consumer goods that are mostly useless and which they soon tire of.  Older people, on the other hand, know which purchases will result in long-term happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<p>My own experience is a good example of this.</p>
<p><code>When I was young, I spent a tremendous amount of money on video games and comic books.</code></p>
<p><code>When I **later** **enrolled in university**, I did not have much money left to pay for my tuition, and was forced to take out a significant number of student loans.</code></p>
<p>Moreover, life is full of unexpected emergencies which often take a significant financial toll on people.  I recently read a newspaper article which pointed out that seventy-five percent of all bankruptcies in the United States are the result of medical expenses. I am well aware that it is humiliating to lose our financial independence.  </p>
<p>For example, last year</p>
<p><code>my uncle suffered a major heart attack which required him to undergo very expensive bypass surgery.</code></p>
<p><strong>He avoided bankruptcy, <em>but</em> did have to ask his elderly parents for a loan to pay his bills.</strong></p>
<p><code>They, unlike him, resisted the urge to spend and saved money through their entire lives.</code></p>
<p><code>He felt extremely embarrassed about begging his parents for assistance, especially as he could have avoided the situation by emulating their frugal behavior.</code></p>
<h1 id="My-essay-2"><a href="#My-essay-2" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>Almost everyone enjoys buying what they want. Some like to spend money right after they earn it, while others prefer saving money for another time in the future. In my opinion, I think it is better to save money in the bank and plan for future. I feel this way <em>for</em> two reasons which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>people struggle to decide if they should spend money satisfying one&#39;s immediate needs or if they should save it for unknown future concerns</code></p>
<p>To begin with, having some money in the bank helps us deal with some of unplanned emergencies. As our lives are full with these emergencies, this money provide important assistance during the time. If we spend all the money we earned right away, we will suffer a lot. My cousin’s experience demonstrates that this is true. Five years ago, he had a job in a busy city. When getting his salary in the first week of each month, he would spend all of it on what he had planned. Unfortunately, his mother got a very serious illness<code>suffered a illness</code> two years ago, which needed a large amount of money in order to operate<code>undergo an expensive surgery</code> a surgery. <code>He did not have much money left to pay for the surgery, and had to take much time to borrow a lot from his friends due to his unwise financial plan.</code> Without prompt treatment, the illness of his mother got more serious. These days he is much more <em>conservative</em> in his spending, and <strong>carefully</strong> consider all of his <em>expenses</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large amount of money we saved for a long time helps us do expensive things such as traveling and studying abroad. As tourism is more popular than ever, the hotel owner has charged increasingly for accommodation. It is so expensive that we need to save money for a long time. For example, when my sister and I planned to study abroad in America, we were surprised by the cost we need. Both of us worked and saved money in order to afford the tuition fee and rent. If I spend money without limit, I would not make it and have the courage to go foreign country. This demonstrates some of the benefits of saving money.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is preferable to saving money for sometime in the future. This is because this money help us to deal with some unplanned emergencies and because we can afford some expensive plan with this money.</p>

<h1 id="Sample-Essay-4"><a href="#Sample-Essay-4" class="headerlink" title="Sample Essay"></a>Sample Essay</h1><p>背景：家庭教育越来越流行。父母相信他们可以做得更好</p>
<p>理由一：父母偏见。为什么偏见？觉得自己孩子聪明  怎么偏见了？ 教的太快  结果孩子有严重后果。<br>理由二：父母观点落后。为什么落后？离开学校都20年了？    怎么落后了？不知道互联网教育   结果让孩子跟不上学习。<br>parents are biased when it comes to their own children. They think their children are the smartest one in the world. As a result, they teach their children in a inappropriately quick pace and mistakenly assume that their kids will be able to keep up. Over a course of and entire school year, this can have serious consequences.<br><code>1.think 用 assume     2.当对象是孩子的时候用 When it comes to      3.a course of an entire school year 学年</code></p>
<p>These days, homeschooling is becoming a more and more popular alternative to traditional learning methods and many parents believe that they can do a better job than professional educators.  I, however, do not agree with the idea that parents are the best teachers.  I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.<br><code>is becoming popular alternative to    and   parents believe</code></p>
<p>First of all, parents are biased when it comes to their own children.  To be specific, most parents think that their children are the smartest in the world.<code>简单句</code>  As a result, they often teach their children <strong>at an inappropriately quick pace</strong> and <strong>mistakenly</strong> <strong>assume</strong> that they will be able to <strong>keep up</strong>.<code>复合句and 第二句副词提前</code>  Over the course of <strong>an entire school year</strong> this can have serious consequences.  An old friend of mine is a good example of this.  <strong>Rather than attending the local public school,</strong> my friend was taught at home by his mother.<code>介绍基本情况</code>  His mother had good intentions, but she failed completely at teaching him math.  She made the assumption that her son was able to grasp the basic concepts right away and moved on immediately to advanced concepts that were a full two grade-levels above what he would have been learning at the public school.  <strong>When it came time for my friend to take the annual state-mandated competency tests</strong> he was wholly unprepared and he <strong>shocked his mom</strong> with a failing grade.  This example demonstrates that, indeed, parents are not always the best teachers.<br>首先，当对自己的孩子时，父母会有偏见。很多父母认为他们的孩子是最聪明的。认为他们跟得上。这有严重的后果。我一个老同学是个很好的例子。 <em>1.基本情况</em>：他不是在当地学校学习，而是在家跟妈妈学。<em>2.简介结果：</em> 他妈妈心是好的，但是她数学教学彻底失败了。<em>3.原因：</em> 她估计他的孩子可以很快的抓住基本概念，然后迅速转向高级的概念。而这些概念在当地学校需要高两级的同学才能理解。  <em>4.结果：</em> 当她参加每年的州里的比赛时，她获得了低分。这个例子告诉我们父母不总是最好的老师</p>
<p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern teaching methods and <strong>therefore</strong> use antiquated and ineffective methods to educate their children.  <strong>Parents have children at increasingly advanced ages nowadays and when it comes time to teach their children, they have been out of school for ten or twenty years.</strong> Professional teachers, <strong>in contrast,</strong> have time for professional development every year of their careers and work in a collaborative environment where experienced teachers are kept up to date by their younger colleagues.  This means that trained teachers excel at teaching children of all backgrounds, while parents struggle to teach their own children.  While my friend’s mother eventually overcame her difficulty teaching math to her son, the next year she had a lot of trouble motivating him to keep up with his language lessons.  She was proactive, though, and sought help from her local school board.  The officials at the board put her in touch with a young teacher from a nearby elementary school.  That teacher showed her how to use the Internet to help her son find foreign-language resources more suited to his specific interests.  Until she got help from that young teacher, she had no idea that the Internet included a wealth of videos, music and games that she could utilize in her home classroom.<br>数学 math<br>我朋友的妈妈，第二年跟不上了</p>
<p>我朋友的妈妈克服苦难教孩子数学，但是第二年她就觉得跟上孩子的课程有难度了／力不从心／跟不上。她很积极，去学校寻求帮助。学校让他与一个任课老师沟通。老师给她演示了现在怎么使用internet去学习外语。  直到她从那个老师获得帮助，她才知道互联网很多视频 游戏 可以用来帮助她的家庭教育。</p>
<p>while my friend’s mother <em>eventually</em> overcame the difficulty teach <em>ing</em> her <em>son</em> math, the next year she had <em>a lot of</em> trouble <em>motivating her son</em> to keep up <em>with</em> the language lesson. She is proactive and sought help from the <em>local</em> school <em>broad</em>. The officials at school let her to communicate with a young teacher <em>from the nearby elementary school</em>. The teacher showed her how to use the internet to <em>find foreign-language resources more suited to his specific interests</em>. until she got help from that <em>young</em> teacher, she has no idea that the internet has a <em>wealth</em> of video <em>s</em> pictures and games <em>that she can utilize in her classroom</em><code>不断具体</code></p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea that parents are the best educators in their children’s lives.  This is because parents see their children with biased eyes and because professional teachers benefit from modern techniques and training.</p>
<h1 id="My-essay-3"><a href="#My-essay-3" class="headerlink" title="My essay"></a>My essay</h1><p>341 words<br>Our parents are the ones who teach us walk and run after we was born. Literally, they are our earliest teachers, but it is controversy to decide whether can do better than many normal teachers. In my opinion, parents are the best teachers. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, parents are more familiar with us than any teacher and easily they with a lot of maturity and life experience are able to give us more appropriate advice. Our teachers, who need to teach many children in class, have no time to find out the best way for each individuals to impart their knowledge. My own experience can demonstrate the importance of method of education. When I was in my high school, I spend a lot of time on my mathematics which I got lowest grade on. My teacher gave me a ton of suggestions, while none of them turned out to be useful. When I ask my dad for help, he immediately pointed out that I misunderstand some important meaning of the question. I progressed much more quickly with the help of my dad than I did while following my teacher’s advice.</p>
<p>Secondly, parents have much more time accompany with their children, and teachers are replaced once a year. It is difficult to develop a good habit because it needs a constant and long time. Our parents have enough opportunity and time urge us to form a good habit. For example, my cousin’s teacher told him to read English every morning and write a diary everyday. His parents help him stay focused and avoid distraction when studying everyday. After one year, he was accustomed to these habit and got things done spontaneously due to the effort of his parents. This demonstrates that their parents are the best teacher in their lives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I strongly believed that parents are the best teacher of their children. This is because they know their children well and because they have abundant time accompany their children.</p>
<h1 id="Imitation"><a href="#Imitation" class="headerlink" title="Imitation"></a>Imitation</h1><p>Secondly, parents are not aware of modern educational methods and therefore use antiquated and ineffective methods to teach their children. <code>原因and therefore结果  避免了 直接parents are likely， because</code></p>
<p>parents have children at an increasingly age and when it came time to teach there children, they have been out of school for ten or even twenty years. Teachers, however, have time for professional development every year of their career and work in a collaborative environment where teachers keep up to date.</p>

<p>#The Question</p>
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p>
<p>#My essay</p>
<p>电视摧毁了朋友与家人之间的交流了么<br>理由一：电视给了我们很多谈资   电视有很多精彩的节目，很多人观看   如果我们都看过，我们可以深入的交流讨论评价电视节目<br><code>\
理由二：电视给了我们与家人朋友在一起的机会   过去 我们各自有各自的娱乐活动， 经常不在一起。   现在，相反，全家人都很爱看电视，这是因为电影很符合很多人的口味   结果在休闲的时候，全家人经常一起看电视，互相聊天，促进了交流。</code></p>

<p>理由二：</p>
<p>These days television plays an important role in our entertainment and almost everyone has their favorite sort of TV programmes. For this reason, there is a lot of debate about whether television has destroyed communication among friends and family. In my opinion, the advent of television has not had a negative effect on the communication. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>Television actually provide us sorts of topics that friends can talk about. There are many fairly popular programmes on TV and if fiend and I have watched them, we are able to have a spirited debate and a deep review about them. As a result, many students in my class become intimate friends because they tend to be fond of a certain TV show. In contrast, those people who don’t watch TV have limited topic in common because they live in simple lives.</p>

<p>#sample essay</p>
<p> However, I strongly believe that the advent of televised entertainment has not had a negative effect on interpersonal communication.  I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>To begin with, I contend that television actually <em>helps</em> people to have more <em>meaningful</em> conversations.  In the past, people mostly talked about what they had in common.  <em>Often</em>, talk of this sort was quite limited <strong>because people lived fairly simple lives.</strong>  These days, <strong>in contrast</strong>, individuals can enjoy spirited discussions about <em>the wide array of current events and world affairs</em> <em>that they hear about on television</em> every day.  For example, I have a regular Friday lunch date with my work colleagues at a local restaurant.  We do talk about office affairs, but most of our conversations are about the wide world around us which we learn about from watching television.  We talk about everything from political developments in distant countries to sports results from entirely different continents.  I strongly believe that without television to supply us with topics, my colleagues and I would talk mainly about banal office gossip.我与同事有个约会，我们讨论公司事物，但我们大部分讨论从电视上得知的这个世界，从政治到体育结果 来自完全不同的洲</p>
<p>Secondly, I am of the opinion that television has mostly replaced solitary activities, rather than replacing interactions with others.  <em>It appears that</em> television has mainly replaced hobbies like reading and exercising.  My own experience is compelling evidence of this.  I grew up in a very rural area without access to stable television signals and as a result, I spent most of my free time reading books and magazines.  When I started university, however, I moved to a big city and suddenly had access to one hundred channels.  Almost immediately, watching shows and movies replaced reading as my primary hobby.  I now read almost no books, but as I indicated in the above paragraph I still have meaningful conversations with friends on a regular basis.（我在一个农村长大，没有电视信号。（and as a result）我大部分时间看书和杂志），当我开始了大学生活，我到了一个大城市，然后突然可以收到很多频道。几乎同时，看show跟电影取代了我原来的hobby。我现在不看电视了，但我仍然与我的朋友有交流。</p>
<p>In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that the advent of television has harmed communication between friends and family.  I feel this way because television supplies us with a variety of topics which we can discuss with our friends, and because television-watching has mostly replaced solitary hobbies  rather than social activities.</p>

<h2 id="tags-8"><a href="#tags-8" class="headerlink" title="tags:"></a>tags:</h2><p>#The Question</p>
<p>People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, increased knowledge). Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>
<p>人们为什么要参加大学<br>理由一：更好的找工作    学习专业技能     高新企业多    获得文凭   社会认可<br>people who have a university degree will be able to get jobs more easily than those don’t. Individuals in possession of only a high school diploma are employed solely in very low paying and low-skilled fields.Our society is developing in a increasingly quick pace and professional knowledge is required in more and more companies. Universities are the best place to achieve these professional skills.</p>
<p>理由二：获得更多的见识 认识更多的人 了解其他地区的文化 学习不同的语言 出国留学</p>
<p>#The Sample Essay</p>
<p>(the question used here came from the Official Guide to the TOEFL)</p>
<p>There are a plethora of reasons why students choose to attend university in this day and age.  In my opinion, the single most important reason is to achieve financial security in the future. I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.</p>
<p>First of all, a university degree is required in order to be hired at even the most basic jobs these days.  Individuals in possession of only a high school diploma are employed solely in very low paying and low-skilled fields.  This fact is evident to young people all over the world right now, and I believe it makes them feel quite a lot of urgency regarding their educational qualifications.  This is demonstrated by the fact that in the past, when people with just a high school education could get satisfying jobs, enrollment at universities was much lower than today.  Moreover, my friends and I have noticed that recently it has even become necessary to have a graduate degree in order to begin a career; no longer is it possible to achieve professional success with just an undergraduate degree.  It seems that this trend will not reverse any time soon, and thus students will continue to consider their financial future when making decisions about what to do when they finish their secondary education.</p>
<p>Moreover, universities provide wonderful opportunities for networking which help young people find high-paying jobs following their graduation.  The unemployment rate has been quite high for most of the past decade and it is very difficult for even well-educated people to find employment.  Many experts argue that the people we meet in university play a large role in our long-term professional success.  For example, my brother recently founded a successful online business which has provided him with a substantial income.  He co-founded the business in a partnership with two like-minded students whom he met in a freshman computer science class.  My brother often points out that the partnership which he formed with his students was even more valuable than the degree that he was awarded four years later.  In contrast to my brother’s success, many of my friends who chose not to attend university have a limited set of contacts as their social circles have expanded very little since childhood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that young people choose to enroll in post-secondary education mostly in order to secure their financial future.  This is because a university degree is a prerequisite for employment in the modern era and because universities provide students with valuable opportunities for networking.</p>
